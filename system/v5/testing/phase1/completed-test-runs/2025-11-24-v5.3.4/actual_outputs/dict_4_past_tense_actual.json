  "text": "Sharing my experience for anyone newly diagnosed with post-bariatric hypoglycemia. Before starting acarbose, I USED TO have terrible shakiness and sweating after every meal. I USED TO get so dizzy I couldn't drive. My life WAS controlled by constant fear of sugar crashes. That WAS my reality for 6 months post-surgery. Now, 3 months on treatment, I'm doing so much better. Still have occasional symptoms but nothing like before.",
