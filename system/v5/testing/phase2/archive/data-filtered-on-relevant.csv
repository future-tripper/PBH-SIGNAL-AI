32679,reddit.com,t3_1pgtbvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pgtbvo/reactive_hypoglycemia_symptoms_with_cgm_data/,Reactive hypoglycemia symptoms with CGM data — looking for guidance while waiting for doctor follow-up (F/30),"Hi! I’m actually asking for my friend not myself. I’m a T1Diabetic and don’t know what “normal” is in non diabetic but my 17 year old brain says this sounds like reactive hypoglycemia…, patient is 30 year old female. 5’5”, normally around 110 lbs but recently dropped to ~102 lbs over the past 2 weeks. 


Here’s what she said “My doctor placed me on a continuous glucose monitor due to new symptoms, but won’t review the data until I’ve collected two full weeks. I’m hoping for some general guidance on whether the last 2 days of data look concerning.”

Symptoms (past 2 weeks):
– Feeling shaky, weak, and moody after eating
– Crushing fatigue immediately after meals
– Headaches after glucose drops
– “Chest tightness” that feels muscular, not cardiac
– Fine while fasting, symptoms start after food
– Weight loss despite eating ~2000 calories/day

Relevant medical history:
– Recurrent myopericarditis following COVID vaccine (on Arcalyst for 1.5 years, stable)
– ADHD on low-dose Jornay PM (20 mg for &gt;3 years, no side effects)
– No known autoimmune disease
– One cousin with Crohn’s disease
– Several relatives with type 2 diabetes
– No GI problems, no menstrual changes, no recent illness

What happened with the CGM:
This morning she did a home “glucose tolerance” test with 74g of carbs (orange soda) after a 12-hour fast. Her fingerstick and CGM matched well.

Her curve looked like this:
– Fasting: ~73 mg/dL
– 30 min: ~150 mg/dL
– 60 min: ~86–95 mg/dL
– 90 min: ~47–56 mg/dL (symptomatic)
– 120 min: low 80s without eating
– Took ~2 hours to feel somewhat normal again

Today and yesterday she’s also had several dips into the 60s after regular meals, even when eating balanced foods. She’s also had episodes where eating simple carbs (Oreos) caused no glucose spike at all. Symptoms feel disproportionate to the numbers, especially after the first drop.

The question:
While waiting for the doctor to review the full 2 weeks of CGM data, does this sound like typical reactive hypoglycemia in an underweight, insulin-sensitive person? Or does anything here warrant earlier follow-up? We’re not looking for a diagnosis — just an idea of whether this pattern is generally considered benign or something that needs sooner evaluation.

I’m eating normally and staying hydrated. No medication changes.

Thanks in advance for any insight — I’ll update with whatever my doctor says after the full review.

The reason I did this was to have better health and more energy to live my life, but I now live like a hermit. The weight is coming off but I’m so exhausted all the time. I try to sip my weak squash or protein coffee but I get sharp pains in my chest. At other times when not drinking I have a dull ache in my chest like something is sitting on it. I’m constantly thirsty and my head pounds. Often I feel faint as soon as I stand up. 

Eating is such a struggle too. I want to give up trying. A few teaspoons of soft food and I’m hurting. I then belch for an hour like Barney from the Simpsons. It’s disgusting. I’m so sick of soup and yogurt now I feel like I’d rather go without. I’ve been sick a few times and the pain in my stomach, throat and upper back is horrid. I also get watery diarrhoea if I don’t take medication every day but I’m barely having 500-600 cals a day. 

I leave the house to walk my dogs maybe 3 times a week. The rest of the time I’m in bed or trying to work from home for a few hours. I feel too tired to go anywhere or commute to the office. By now I thought I’d be out and about, but I just want to nap. I’ve done nothing for Christmas. I feel like my colleagues must think I’m swinging the lead. I also feel guilty that I’m letting my family down. 

Did anyone else feel this down at this stage? I’m starting to feel like I’m going crazy.

They did a CT scan at the ER, found nothing. They acted like I was making it all up. It was a horrible experience. I talked to my surgeon directly this morning and he sent me for an upper GI study and also found nothing.

The best they are coming up with is it's possibly an ulcer, and throwing meds at me.  I do not think for one second it's an ulcer.

Doctors deny Lyme exists, refuse treatment for years, destroyed my life – I look like I’m in alcohol withdrawal but I don’t drink","38M I am 38 years old. Since childhood I have been bitten by many ticks – practically every year, and scratched multiple times by cats.  
Anxiety started in childhood, then hand tremor appeared, later legs and eventually the head. I had fevers, severe and prolonged headaches and neck pain. My immunity was practically zero – drinking cold water was enough to get sick, or falling asleep with an open window – the same.  
Extreme reaction to stress: uncontrollable shaking and trembling of the entire body – it was enough for someone to just look at me and within a second my legs would shake like a drunk person. It happened at school, at the checkout, in church – everywhere, and it was deeply humiliating.

Years passed, doctors repeatedly refused to test me for Lyme disease (borreliosis), sent me away with nothing or prescribed antidepressants for years.  
I ended up in hospital many times with heart problems – they told me I was going to die, that my heart wouldn’t hold out, asked who to notify in case of death. The next day I was discharged with antidepressants again – and that was it, nothing else was done.

I did all possible tests to rule out essential tremor. One doctor asked about Lyme but didn’t test for it because earlier an infectious disease specialist had given me just one week of antibiotics.  
I had many tick bites, migrating erythema at the bite sites, and a positive Western Blot test for Lyme disease – 6 bands positive.

Doctors don’t believe in (chronic) Lyme disease. I have seen many neurologists and GPs – just mentioning the word „borreliosis” made them yell that „everyone has it!” and they did nothing.  
I was losing orientation – I would walk through the city for two hours on foot, then suddenly regain consciousness and have no idea where I was or why I was walking.  
I didn’t recognise my own mother’s face. Memory has been tragic since childhood – I can’t do 2 + 7 in my head without a calculator. I forgot how many years I had lived in a particular place, sometimes I didn’t know where I was in my own house.

A psychosomatic medicine doctor and a psychiatrist ruled out psychiatric causes. I fought with the psychiatrist that I don’t have depression – she sent me to a psychotherapist. He listened to me and explained to her that the only problem is that I cannot work because I have no control over my muscles.  
In stress I walked like a drunk, legs shaking violently – I looked like someone in alcohol withdrawal. Under stress, muscle tension or emotions the tremor was 10 times stronger. Sometimes I couldn’t use a computer mouse or type on a phone because my hands were shaking so much – but it is not essential tremor (as they suspected) because sometimes it almost disappears. It is always present to some degree, but essential tremor cannot disappear or improve and then suddenly get several times worse. After coffee it was a disaster.

They refuse to treat me for Lyme disease because a new IgM ELISA came back negative/within norms. I think these tests are not reliable at all and cannot rule anything out.  
One neurologist wanted to send me for a consultation before DBS (deep brain stimulation) surgery because he doesn’t know what is wrong with me – but for some reason neuroborreliosis terrifies them.

I have seen more than 7 neurologists: one said everything is fine, another Parkinson’s, another suggested I might be addicted to something, another essential tremor. Meanwhile I have been suffering every day for 38 years.  
I couldn’t catch parcels at the postal sorting facility – everyone thought I was drunk, but I don’t drink.  
I stopped all tremor and depression medications – they never helped anyway.

For the last 2 months I have been taking herbs for Lyme disease, Babesia and Bartonella – I clearly react (Herxheimer reactions), tremor gets much worse, heart beats irregularly, but when the Herx passes I sometimes see significant improvement – I can even walk better.  
I have been in many countries and always ended up in ambulances. In one hospital they removed 6 ticks from me – I begged for antibiotics, they refused. Six years ago in the UK I said it might be Lyme, the doctor replied that the bite was long ago, while I was writhing in back pain.

Memory is tragic – I don’t remember yesterday, I can’t orient myself in time – how long I have been somewhere: a month, a year, several years.  
When the tremor intensified I had extreme anxiety, panic, even auditory and visual hallucinations.  
Even without stress, in hospital I couldn’t walk straight – I looked like someone in severe delirium when going to the toilet. The staff looked at me with contempt as if I were a drug addict – antidepressants and end of treatment. Neurologists all said different things.

Now I am in Poland, but here they have even banned testing ticks removed from people „so as not to spread panic”. They don’t believe that neuroborreliosis/Lyme can be chronic.  
I feel like a person with a broken leg who is given antidepressants instead of real help.

In church it was enough for someone to look at me and my whole body shook – but for example today it didn’t happen. Sometimes it is there, sometimes not, sometimes extreme. Everything fluctuates – gets worse or better.  
For the first time in my life I found descriptions of people who had exactly the same symptoms as me – Lyme, or Bartonella, or Babesia, or all together – and after about a year of proper treatment (often 6 months to noticeable improvement) it went away. They also wrote that finally they can leave the house and be among people again.

I don’t know what to do – when I tell doctors, they don’t believe me, they think I’m crazy.  
Extreme fatigue sometimes lasted for years – after 16 hours of sleep I was still completely exhausted, had no strength for anything.  
In my medical records I have a positive Lyme test, I had migrating erythema and over 100 tick bites in my life.",,,,2025-11-24 12:00:30.478875+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-11-24 11:08:42,1763982522,,"[""infectious_disease""]","[""anxiety"",""tremor"",""fevers"",""headaches"",""neck pain"",""extreme fatigue"",""memory issues"",""hallucinations""]","[""antibiotics"",""antidepressants""]","[""Lyme disease"",""neuroborreliosis""]",[],"[""Lyme disease diagnosis"",""tremors and migraines"",""hallucinations"",""unreliable Lyme disease tests"",""antibiotic treatment""]",relevant,0.85,,Long-term complex symptom profile with infectious disease background.,patient,0.9,"[""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Infectious Disease""]",frustration,,"[""frustration""]","[""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_infectious_disease_048"",""symptoms_anxiety_030"",""symptoms_tremor_029"",""symptoms_fevers_031"",""symptoms_headaches_020"",""symptoms_neck_pain_035"",""symptoms_extreme_fatigue_037"",""symptoms_memory_issues_038"",""symptoms_hallucinations_039"",""conditions_Lyme_disease_042"",""conditions_neuroborreliosis_043"",""treatments_antibiotics_033"",""treatments_antidepressants_034""]",,3,"{""id"" : 20141, ""name"" : ""Ordinary-Standard668"", ""handle"" : ""Ordinary-Standard668"", ""gender"" : null, ""age"" : null, ""subscribers"" : null, ""created_at"" : ""2025-11-24T12:00:29.823141+00:00""}","{""id"" : 7, ""subreddit_name"" : ""AskDocs"", ""description"" : null}"

My doctor thinks I have BPPV and gave me exercises and meds for headache and dizziness which don’t help.

Not asking for a diagnosis, more just wondering if doctors get annoyed when patients ask for more testing when treatment doesn’t improve symptoms.

I’ve been referred to PT but cannot be seen until late January. I’d like to get a referral to ENT or neurology to make sure there is nothing else going on. 

A couple years ago I was having issues with frequent urination and they sent me to PT which did not help. I had an mri for lower back pain and they incidentally found a very large uterine fibroid that was pressing on my bladder. After having it removed and recovery that has been resolved.

I have concerns (maybe unjustified) that there is something else going on causing these new symptoms. I have some congenital malformations of spine and vascular in arms, so I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility for there to be other issues. 

Would it be unreasonable to request more testing to rule out larger issues than BPPV while waiting for PT?

Need direction.,"I’m a 20-year-old male. Since February 2024, I’ve been dealing with a cluster of symptoms that happen every time I eat any kind of protein, including:
meat (chicken, fish, beef, etc.)
eggs
dairy
nuts &amp; seeds
whey protein
plant protein powders
The reaction is the same no matter the source.
My symptoms after protein intake:
lower-left abdominal cramping
headaches
calf cramping/pain
fatigue and “brain pressure”
feeling like food isn’t being absorbed
I stopped building muscle completely
libido dropped significantly
Before all this started, I used to get seborrheic dermatitis flare-ups after eating some of these foods.
Now I don’t get skin flares — instead, everything hits my GI system and overall energy/hormones.
Testing I’ve already done (all normal):
full bloodwork: CBC, CMP, kidney/liver tests
iron, ferritin, B12, folate
inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR
abdominal CT scan
abdominal MRI
urine tests
rheumatology workup
GI consult
Every doctor says “nothing is wrong,” but the symptoms are real and reproducible after every protein-containing meal.
Why I’m posting:
I’m trying to understand what could cause consistent adverse reactions to all protein sources when standard imaging and blood tests are normal. I’m not looking for a diagnosis — just guidance on what mechanisms or further testing might explain this.

Is it strep, mono, tonsillitis?","I’ve been dealing with a cold on and off. I have a now 6 month old son in daycare, also with a cold/cough that’s lasted for 3 months. I’ve probably been getting my colds from him.

A month or so ago, I had a terrible sore throat that accompanied a nasty chest cold. The area near my tonsils and uvula were all red. Had a strep test, which was negative. They said my throat was just irritated due to the cold and from coughing so much. A week later I noticed small white patches on my tonsils. No fever, but I freaked out thinking now I got strep. Had another strep test which was negative. The doctor took a culture to see if my cold was viral or bacterial and prescribed me amoxicillin (even though I didn’t know if what I had was bacterial or not). The doc said the white patches on my tonsils may just be tonsil stones caused by my cold.

I had to stop talking the Amoxicillin at some point because it was causing me to throw up. I didn’t think it really helped though. The sore throat eventually just went away on its own.

Fast forward to now, I have a cold again. Yesterday I woke up with a sore throat and attributed it to not getting enough sleep. Gradually the sore throat got worse through the day, especially on one side. I checked out my throat and saw it was all red again, and the white patches on my tonsils were back. It hurts on my left side more than the right.

Here is a photo:

Again, no fever, but the pain is radiating worse this time. My neck itself feels bruised when I press on it, my jaw feels sore and I just feel very tired with an overall headache. I could not sleep through the night because of the pain.

Main Results: right iliac fossa has been examined. Appendix has not been visualised. Therefore appendicitis cannot be reliably excluded. 
Approx 7 prominent lymph nodes within the right iliac fossa with the largest measuring 20x8x12mm, raising the possibility of mesenteric adenitis for clinical correlation.

Hear me out..,"18, Male, 5’5” 210 lbs, no prior history with cancer within myself nor my family, no drugs or alcohol. I’ve been growing concerned because I’ve had this tiny lump on my left testicle on the skin of it for about a year now. It’s never made me uncomfortable nor caused me any pain but recently it was brought to my attention that maybe it could be cancerous. I always thought testicular cancer was like a small lump on the actual inside of my yknow… balls. Not on the actual skin outside. Now I’m growing concerned and worried that I have to get it checked or whatnot. I know it’s not a pimple or any sort of ingrown hair as I’ve even tried picking at it to “pop” it I guess but it’s not something like that it’s a small somewhat hard bump on my body. Not to mention if it was any of those I’m sure it would’ve disappeared after a year of having it… I haven’t had any kind of sexual relations with anyone within that year of me having this issue either, so I’m truly wondering where it came from and what it could be. But my question is if it’s not really causing me any pain or discomfort should I even bother? Im not trying to have an expensive visit for something so silly.

I’ve recently lost 85 lbs. I have dense breast tissue. No family history of breast cancer but extensive history of prostate cancer on my dad’s side. 

Earlier this year, I had my iron levels checked and was found to have iron deficient anemia. I started iron pills and I was sent for an ultrasound for my uterus and they found signs of adenomyosis and an endometrioma on one of my ovaries. I didn’t really want to go on birth control. I’ve always just had heavy periods and taking iron pills was helping my anemia and it wasn’t that big of a deal for me, so I decided I didn’t need to do anything for the diagnosis. Since I was done having kids and lost a ton of weight I wanted to swap implants, lift, and do a tummy tuck. My plastic surgeon sent me for a mammogram before surgery and it was abnormal. As soon as that happened I met with a genetic counselor because I figured if they found cancer knowing my genetic risks would affect my decision and if it wasn’t then it was good for me to know since some prostate cancer genes also result in breast cancer. 

Pathology and genetic panel came back at the same time, they found DCIS grade 2 HR+ but no genetic mutations. This happened this week. I’m trying to wrap my head around it all and my plastic surgeon is going to help me find a breast surgeon and we’ll do the reconstruction at the same time. I really just want to have a mastectomy since I’ve read dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast cancer and the fact that I’m “young” also increases the risk. I also have severe anxiety so I just want to be done with it. I also met with a gynecologist to discuss everything and since my cancer is HR+ any birth control option to address the adenomyosis is off the table.  I am having a ton of spotting and in general more issues with the adenomyosis so a hysterectomy is my only option to treat. I don’t even know where to start here. 

My gynecologist said tummy tucks can be scheduled with hysterectomies and my plastic surgeon says he regularly does mastectomies and reconstruction, and then also regularly does hysterectomies and tummy tucks. He hasn’t done all 4 but we’d just have to see if we can coordinate doctors and such. I really don’t want to have a list of surgeries to get in the future. It would be fantastic to see if I could just go under once and do it all 

I guess I just want help on who to go see first or next or really anyone that can help me prioritize the doctors and surgeries. I know breast surgeon and breast surgery has to happen no matter what and see if the breast surgeon is on board with doing a bilateral mastectomy. If I do a bilateral mastectomy will the oncologist want to do radiation and/or hormone therapy? How would doing any of those affect the adenomyosis? I know it’s probably complicating things doing the cosmetic surgeries but I’m really hoping to do the implant and tummy tuck since it was my original goal and worked my butt off to lose those 85 lbs and having to delay that has gotten me pretty down. It’s what I’ve been looking forward to for over a year.

I have been to a vascular surgeon, cardiologist, ortho, and am waiting to see cardiothoracic. 

Link to photos: https://imgur.com/a/5j62clt

I am a 30 year old female with an extensive medical history. I was born with a rare condition called “Arthrogryposis.” It is characterized by multiple joint contractures causing stiff joints, muscle weakness, and pain. It affects my whole body (musculoskeletal) and is not known to affect the vascular system. I have had multiple bone reconstructive surgeries, most recently being an ankle fusion on my left ankle in October 2024. (I’ll include X rays from 11/2024 after surgery, other photos have month/year written on them)

My main symptoms are discoloration, numbness, extreme coldness, cramping, sores, and general pain in my left ankle that is fused. This began in July but progressed rapidly between October and now. The ultrasounds made the doctors originally suspect peripheral artery disease (PAD) but that is no longer being considered. I had an angiogram last Friday that found 100% stenosis in my left dorsalis pedis artery (less than .5mm in size). 

However, the cardiologist says the severity of my symptoms doesn’t fully line up with the diagnosis if it is only my dorsalis pedis artery affected. I realized looking through photos this seems to be progressing quickly. My PT mentioned I am losing the little function I have and yet doctors are assuring me it’s not emergent, and that essentially there is nothing to be done except to exercise more(?). This is affecting my quality of life and I have fought SO hard to be where I’m at, able to walk and have a full life, married, full time job, etc. 

Right now, the plan is to start 50mg Pletal 2x daily.

I am open to all thoughts and so appreciative if you’ve made it this far. I have found I am very difficult to diagnose because of my unusual anatomy. I walked on a foot with multiple fractures for a year being assured it was arthritis. Turns out it was 3 chronic fractures and many other fractures healing.

I recently had an abdominal ultrasound due to some slightly elevated platelets and a family history of bad gall bladders (basically no one on my mom’s side of the family has one, mom, grandpa, aunt, my brother).

Everything mostly came back as normal on the ultrasound, gall bladder (which was a surprise honestly), pancreas, kidney etc.

But my liver showed minimal changes in the contour and it was reading diffusely brighter. No masses detected.  My doc has referred me to GI to get it checked out further.

My question is what could have caused this?  I do not drink.  I have never been drunk once in my life, and I do not smoke.

The only medications I take other than birth control are an antihistamine, a multivitamin, and some OTC pain relievers as needed.  I never go above the recommended dosage.  I was taking zinc and copper, but I stopped after I got sick 3 times in a row and it clearly wasn’t boosting my immune system.

23 days before my ultrasound I had a colonoscopy with anesthesia (also for family history, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer at 48, mine came back all clear).

A week before the ultrasound I was put on Amoxicillin-Clav due to a severe sinus infection, I was on my last dosage the day of the ultrasound.  Immediately following the ultrasound we tested positive for Flu B and Strep (my daughter started pre-K and my son is in 3rd grade.  I feel like I can’t keep my head above water.)

So I guess my question is could the anesthesia from the colonoscopy on top of the sinus infection and antibiotic on top of the flu and strep diagnosis have impacted my liver?

I feel like it’s definitely possible given the function of the liver, but I guess I’m trying to calm myself down because I’m freaking out, because it’s my liver.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I appreciate it.

I’ve been having vision issues for several years. Four years ago I lost my peripheral vision. The rest of my vision is blurred, and I have significant issues seeing things. I walk into stuff, knock things over, etc. I was 23 when it happened originally, I’m 31 now so I think it’s safe to say it isn’t temporary. I have been to several docs about this, including a neuro ophthalmologist. I had hoped that last one would be able to tell me SOMETHING, but I left with more questions than answers. He said, and I quote, my “vision is fine, it just takes me a long time to get there.” In reference to me having to stare at something for a few seconds before I can make sense of it. I don’t know, that doesn’t SOUND fine to me- I’m pretty sure most people can just see stuff? Maybe I’m wrong? He also mentioned my eyes and the nerve were normal. He said I don’t need glasses or anything, which is odd to me since I’ve had reading glasses prescribed for years. It’s also odd since I, as I mentioned, can’t see well at all. I have also been denied a license due to vision issues, so there’s something going on for sure, I just can’t figure out what. Does anyone have any idea why my vision might take so long to decipher? If this isn’t an eye issue, what COULD it be? I can’t move through life without significant issues due to messed up vision, but I don’t know where to go from here. If anyone could point me in a direction to explore, I’d be really really grateful. I feel lost about how to move forward. Thank you for your time and for reading this far.

medications: only had been taking lexapro at the time the issues started. Currently taking Wellbutrin, lexapro, aspirin. Issues did not improve after stopping medication, I have depression and PTSD that is well managed and confirmed not the source of the eye issues by psyche. I also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome hypermobile type- diagnosed professionally by a renowned EDS specialist, NOT self diagnosed. I am unsure if EDS is related to this, as far as I’m aware my doctor did not seem to think it was caused by it.

Since October: non-stop debilitating diarrhea, severe weakness, and constant hand tingling/numbness. I'm afraid I have severe malabsorption (B12/fat deficiency) and it's compromising my job. Considering reversal. Also, I haven’t smoked or drank alcohol. Help! 

🚨 Symptoms &amp; Status

Surgery: Feb 2025 (RNY).

Initial: Experienced dumping/anxiety in June after exercise; improved temporarily.

Now (Since Oct):

GI: Chronic, severe diarrhea.

Neuro: Persistent hand tingling/numbness (paresthesia).

Energy: Crippling weakness; very low functional energy.                                                      
Questions:

Has anyone experienced this exact cluster (chronic diarrhea + neurological symptoms)? What was the fix (SIBO? EPI? B12 shots)?

What specific tests should I demand from my doctor besides a standard vitamin panel (e.g., Fecal Elastase or 72-Hour Fecal Fat)?

Reversal: Did anyone opt for a reversal due to life-altering, unmanaged malabsorption? Was it successful?

I am medically compliant and following up, but I need real-world experiences.

I'm 33M, back around 2017, severe depression eating after fighting Cancer left me at a whopping 350lbs. The one single event that served as my catalyst for beginning a weight loss journey was a sudden onset of daily Panic Attacks, that I took as my ""point of no return"". Over the next  year I heavily cut my calories, switched to a diet of turkey sandwiches and salads, and made use of my apartment complex Gym up to twice a day with cardio and some weight lifting. By the time Covid forced my gym to be closed in 2020 I had lost 150lbs. However by that point I had gotten a Warehouse job which essentially helped me maintain without exercise. I then caught a Covid infection in 2022, and the illness made me lose some more weight, bringing me to my all time lowest of 196lbs.

However that was my plateau. After recovering, I gained 25lbs back and have been stuck there since. Even with the gym accessible again, I have zero energy to drag myself back to a daily routine. I know I eat too many carbs and have attempted to go back to salads but the craving for something pleasurable is too much. I'm sitting right now around 225lbs, and even though that's still a far cry from my previous obesity, I'm still very fat, with my excess skin accentuating it all.

I’m 19years old male, 172c, 70kg, arab, no medications 
since I was a kid I’ve been able to make my heart beat a lot faster whenever I want no breathing tricks no moving,  no stress or emotional triggers, nothing. I just decide to do it and my heart rate shoots up immediately.

It feels strange because my body gets tense, like it wants to move on its own, and I can actually feel the blood being pumped harder through my heart and after doing it I feel short on oxygen but a few deep breaths fix it. and I also feel a bit of chest discomfort(pain) when I exhale, it lasts a few minutes and then it fades.
 I can also stop it whenever I want, it just takes a few seconds to settle back to normal.

I’ve been doing this for years and I don’t think it’s a superpower, nothing like that. I just genuinely can’t find anything online about this. And honestly, I don’t think it’s worth the trouble of going to a doctor and trying to explain it. I don’t want to be that guy who walks in like “hey, I can control my heartbeat” and ends up being the joke of the week.

I’m just trying to figure out if this is harmless, if I should stop doing it(since it is not useful anyway), or if anyone else has experienced something similar.

Only meds are otc iron on occasion. No tobacco no marijuana no alcohol.

Over a year now I've been struggling with these symptoms that have not been given a proper diagnosis. A friend has wondered if it's hypoglycemia, but docs have said my blood sugar is normal and it's unlikely to be that. Short backstory as to how the symptoms developed as well later in the post.

So I'll get tingly hands, tingly fingers. Sometimes the tip of my tongue feels numb, and my lips tingle. Dizzy. Lightheaded. Confused almost, and I'm grabbing on to whatever is near me because I feel like I'm going to pass out, or I feel like my balance has been compromised. Weak. My legs start to feel like they will give out and it almost feels like my calves just freeze up or like the blood in my legs just pools (especially if standing for a long period of time without moving around, sitting, etc). Can't focus on what I'm doing literally and figuratively. Eyes are darting around trying to keep awake and I'm wondering ""oh that's not the lemons, why did I grab the tweezers instead."" The few times I have ""passed out"" (I didn't black out but I fell after my body just gave in) my head is falling to the side, I'm super weak w/ barely any energy to speak, but conscious enough to ask for water, salt and sugar. Wouldn't say I necessarily get tunnel vision but it sure feels like I can't focus on much at all. Once it passes I use the restroom a few times lol. And I get tired sometimes after it passes. One time it happened after I got my blood pressure read. Hot weather can trigger it too, or when my shoes are too warm (the worst, I always carry sandals now.)

Eating helps SO MUCH, especially protein. Earlier in the year I was ALWAYS hungry and I was always craving protein. Chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner. My chicken cravings have slowed considerably. If I don't feel satiated with a meal then the symptoms come back after a short time (1-3 hrs). An increase in carbs has helped as well. More variety w veggies and fruit for micro elements and nutrients has helped as well. Oddly enough, caffeine helps as well (appetite suppression?)

Doctor has recommended increased water and salt intake which also helps immensely, but it's not enough sometimes. Sometimes I just pour salt into my hand, throw it in my mouth and bring it down with some water. Electrolytes curb the symptoms until I can eat. Sugar helps my symptoms but it's the same. Or when I'm eating having a juice with my meal really helps to keep me satiated, as well as additional salt in my food. Due to mildly low iron which my doctor does not think is causing symptoms, iron supplements have been recommended on period days only (65mg) but I will take 9-18mg throughout the month which helps A LOT as well. It leaves me feeling less hungry tbh, more energized for sure.

So many times I've been told it's anxiety, but it sure doesn't feel like it is. I've been told it's POTS, but then the diagnosis was rescinded due to the fact that I can stand for much longer than what the tilt table test or the qualifications say. In fact, sitting for a long period of time can make me feel worse! Exercise helps a considerable amount! When I'm up and active, sometimes I won't feel symptoms for hours. But also, must have eaten a meal or feel satiated enough before I can move around and not worry about grabbing onto chairs or so. Each time by doctors I'm told, ""It's not diabetes. It's not hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar is normal. You're not anemic. You're very healthy.""

These symptoms started emerging with dizziness and tingling in my arm and left side last year, with a really bad vitamin b12 deficiency after severe illness and broken ribs. It's been downhill ever since, with the occasional ups. Left me stressed cause I didn't have a physical outlet for my energy. I was diagnosed with PCOS which was rescinded cause I didn't meet all the qualifications. I definitely was not eating very well, I'd go hours without eating or just eat small meals, wasn't eating meat. It wasn't a good time. I think I was malnourished or something...

In addition to these symptoms, this whole year I've struggled with insomnia as well, my latest bed time being 8:30am, though it's gotten considerably better, I'd say I don't struggle with that much anymore (maybe once or twice a month). First half of the year I went to physical therapy for spine, neck, left arm/shoulder. Pain and tingles down my spine and on the left side of my body, mainly in my arm. Headaches in the left side of my head. Was told the pain is real but it's likely stress related (Alan Gordon's The Way Out was recommended to me). Last December-January was told I may have a blood clot, had stroke-like symptoms, and uncontrollable shaking and severe weakness that left me unable to walk without assistance some days and ended me up in the ER, where each time I was told it's anxiety or fatigue and blood work is normal (aside from low Vitamin D which is normal in the winter). MRI's of my head and neck where everything was fine. CT scan of my head saying everything is fine. My days often look like this: wake up 10am-12pm, eat, sit while eating a meal slowly and getting up and getting more food before I feel good enough to go change, eat some more, sit some more and eat, by 4-6pm I feel I have enough energy to get me through the day, where it ends at 12am or 2am and everything is closed. Worried about driving and me feeling faint while driving or not having food. I need to uber prepare with lots of food and beverages before doing anything

I'm confused, lost, sometimes hopeless about a diagnosis and getting to a normal life once again. It's been difficult finding and keeping a job due to this. I carry a lunch bag with food everywhere I go now (yes everywhere) as I never know when my symptoms will flare up. My whole life flipped upside down. I was a dancer previously, but everything changed when I developed a severe cough and broken ribs. I need help.

I had a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound today and I have not received the radiologist report yet. I only have the tech notes, and I am trying to understand them while I wait.

For the last year+ I have been getting monthly UTI symptoms that always start right before my cycle and ease during the first few days of my period. All cultures are negative, so they are trying to figure out if this is related to my urinary tract or my reproductive organs. They mentioned possible endometriosis or IC.

From the tech notes: 
-Uterus appears heterogeneous
-LT UT questionable isoechoic hyper area measuring 1.1x1x0.9 cm
-LT UT hypo area measuring 0.5x0.4x0.5 cm
-RT OV FOLLS NOTED
-LT OV CYST 3.4 CM

My ovary volumes:
Right ovary volume 8.25 ml
Left ovary volume around 30 to 35 ml

I have a CT urogram next week and a cystoscopy in January. While I wait for the radiologist interpretation, I wanted to ask:

-What does a heterogeneous uterus usually indicate?
-What does LTUT questionable isoechoic hyper area mean?
-Is it normal for one ovary volume to be several times larger than the other?
-Do these findings line up with my symptoms or what the doctors are looking for?

I’d also like to know if I’d have to pay this upfront? Or if most hospitals/surgeons have payment plans I could ask about cause I’d have to work out some options to cover the costs.

Our favorite spot has an open mic night on Fridays where our band performs. I always order the same thing — a strawberry daiquiri. It never gets me drunk or even tipsy, but this past Friday, something was off. Before our band went on stage, I felt like I was going to shit myself. I ran to the bathroom. Time felt really strange, alternating between too fast and too slow. I experienced horrible brain fog. It was hard to even wipe myself. I got myself cleaned up and went on stage with my bandmates. I got through the performance okay, but I forgot melodies and lyrics, and at one point even how to sing. I had to get off stage early. We were up there less than an hour, and by then, my pupils were huge and my face and tongue were numb. When I got home, I discovered I’d pissed myself without realizing. I was nauseous and my asshole felt loose. I felt more coherent but still high.

She was not a DSer like me, but she had a distal RNY, which shares the same nutritional needs as similar malabsorption. Together, we learned and shared what vitamins are needed, how to read lab results, track trends, and lead a healthy life. We were close once, helping new DSers learn ""the ropes"" from Cincinnati to Indianapolis. I moved out of state, and we kept up on social media for a long time, but I dropped off social media, and we lost touch. 

I just got a message from another friend over the weekend and learned that Beth fell off of the vitamin wagon. Her magnesium levels tanked and got her admitted to the hospital and then rehabilitative care, where she got COVID, which led to an infection that killed her kidneys and she filled with fluids. They took her off of life care yesterday so she could die in peace. She was supposed to be married next week. 

I'm so angry because *she knew better*. We mourned the loss of others in our online community who fell to a similar fate. Never in a million years would I imagine she would be another example to share with others, but here we are. She let life get in the way of her health, and now she has none. 

Vitamins and bloodwork are absolute necessities to your vitality after WLS. If you cannot afford bariatric vitamins, guess what? They aren't necessary. You can piece together everything you need on your own, thanks to Amazon. Even the 50,000 iu of dry D3 that I take everyday is OTC in a tiny little pill these days. There are no excuses, and believe me when people say you must drink 64oz daily, eat protein-forward, and take vitamins for the rest of your life, do it all like your life depends on it, because it does.

I know that my life is going to improve and only get better by the weight loss. I’m still terrified of the changes surgery is going to make to my body. I’m sure I’ll adapt. 

I’ve lost 14lbs over the last two weeks. The uncontrollable diarrhea has been the worse. I’ve experienced some pretty mortifying moments with my husband who has been amazing. 

I was really down on myself about the fact that I have to get surgery to save my life because what I’ve done to it. Thankfully, I was able to process those feelings. 

I have thought about several things that have happened to me this year due to my weight. One of them, I fell down in my doctor’s office building and I couldn’t get up. Four doctors had to come out and help my husband lift me up. Incomprehensible demoralization. I just know when I lose the weight I won’t have to suffer this kind of embarrassment again. Other kinds of embarrassment, sure, but not the embarrassment of not being able to get up after a fall. 

I’m extremely hopeful about this surgery. I truly believe my diastolic heart failure will get better. I’ve been in a wheelchair since that fall and I’m so grateful I’ll get my mobility back. 

I’ve lost 79lbs total since February. I’m going into the surgery at 296.8

Wife's severe complications 9 months post-op (2nd Bypass) - Low Albumin, Severe Dumping?, Hand Tremors.","Hello everyone. I'm posting because my wife is having severe complications after her Bypass surgery, and I'm desperate for information. The doctors don't seem to be helping.

My wife had a revision surgery in **February 2025**. This is her second bypass; her first one was in 2010.

In 2024, they found she had a slightly twisted colon (which they said can happen to bariatric patients) and needed surgery to prevent an obstruction. Since she had regained all the weight from her 2010 bypass, they decided to combine the colon surgery with a bypass revision.

My wife is 45 years old. She has fibromyalgia and arthritis, and the bypass was recommended to help with the joint pain and weight. In February, she weighed 110 kg (242 lbs). She has lost weight and is now down to 78 kg (172 lbs).

The first few months after surgery seemed normal. She was losing weight steadily.

But in August of this year, after a work flight, she came home with severely swollen legs and feet. She had already been feeling very weak for a few weeks before this.

After blood tests and several doctor visits, they told us her **albumin was very low**, which, according to the doctors, explained her **low blood pressure** and **low blood sugar**.

She cannot tolerate the supplements the surgeon recommended, like Glucerna or ProWhey. One doctor recommended Fortisip Compact Protein. Within 4 days of starting it, her symptoms of retching and vomiting got significantly worse.

She cannot tolerate these concentrated supplements; they make her vomit. Now, 9 months post-op, she is worse than ever. She has constant episodes of **severe heartburn and gas (eructing)**, even without eating. **Water makes her vomit.** She can barely tolerate drinking anything, especially anything sweet.

It's a vicious cycle. She is severely malnourished, especially low in protein (low albumin), but the protein supplements make her vomit. This means she can't eat, which just makes the malnutrition worse.

We are desperate. I don't know what to do, and the doctors don't seem to be helping. In the last few days, my wife has also developed **hand tremors**.

I’m so incredibly bloated after a few sips of any of my many types protein drinks. It feels counterintuitive to continue to drink when I feel full so quickly.

diagnoses: ehlers danlos syndrome, gastroparesis, hypoglycemia
meds: lamotrigine, vyvanse, trulance


so, i had an appointment with the endocrinologist last week and im curious about what she had to say and other thoughts on my situation.
i’ve had hypoglycemia episodes chronically likely for many years, but actually caught and looked into this year. ive been monitoring it for almost a year with a cgm and finger stick glucose monitor by instruction of my physician.


ive had gastroparesis for awhile (diagnosed in 2022). the endocrinologist isn’t sure why i have the hypoglycemia, but one of her ideas to look into was that with the sudden weight losses i’ve had (worst has been this year) that my glucose stores aren’t working well. my nutritional intake isn’t very good (one meal a day, or one snack for my meal a day, or sometimes days without food due to vomiting or just unable to stomach anything).
she brought up the idea of a feeding tube as just a thought as maybe it would help me not have so many lows (especially overnight) and build those storages up better.


i don’t want a tube, but i would accept it if that was decided as the best option and if it would help me feel better and have more energy and fix the low glucose.
i did talk with my gi about a tube as more curiosity plus not being able to tolerate a proper diet a few years ago. she said that it wouldn’t be recommended unless i was dangerously underweight and my labs were not good. i was at a more normal bmi and weight at the time (about 120lbs and im 5’1, was about 160lbs when i started having symptoms of gastroparesis). that made sense to me and i continued trying to get the best nutrition i could by mouth. i also struggle with fluid intake and have had to get iv fluids occasionally over the last couple years.


i am now at 111.2lbs as of today and its dropping more and more (was 115lbs at my appointment last week). i do see my gi next week and will be talking with her about this to get her thoughts. my most recent labs showed low vitamin d, low vitamin b-12, low protein, low calcium, iron deficiency, low folic acid. my fluid intake is around 1-2 cups of water, 1 diet coke (settles my stomach).


anyways my question is, would my endocrinologist’s idea about a tube be a good idea? and would a tube be indicated for me?
i know im not considered underweight yet and my labs aren’t extremely dire.
i dont want a tube, but my options seem limited and i just want to feel better and have more energy because i feel terrible physically. if i did get a tube, i dont want it permanently at all.",,,,2025-11-16 00:00:14.626958+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-11-15 23:12:08,1763248328,,"[""nutritional_support""]","[""hypoglycemia"",""weight_loss"",""poor_nutritional_intake""]",[],"[""ehlers_danlos_syndrome"",""gastroparesis""]",[],"[""monitoring with CGM"",""poor nutritional intake"",""considering feeding tube""]",borderline,0.6,,Discussion of hypoglycemia monitoring and nutritional challenges,patient,0.9,"[""Symptoms"",""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Diet""]",neutral,,[],"[""seeking_advice""]",[],[],,3,"{""id"" : 15698, ""name"" : ""sad-loser-00"", ""handle"" : ""sad-loser-00"", ""gender"" : null, ""age"" : null, ""subscribers"" : null, ""created_at"" : ""2025-10-31T08:00:25.589424+00:00""}","{""id"" : 7, ""subreddit_name"" : ""AskDocs"", ""description"" : null}"

My surgery is this coming Tuesday so I started using their protein as part of my pre surgery diet and it is making me so bloated and miserable.

I checked the label and there’s chicory in all but one of the flavors I got. Wish I’d thought to check for that, it’s always been an issue for me.

Anyway, I’m switching back to my usual protein fpr the rest of the pre op and may just stick with it after surgery despite their dire warnings to only use theirs.

Pretty sure theirs is just the Celebrate brand with their logo slapped on.

Had the procedure back in May of 24. I lost my weight very quickly to include a lot of muscle wasting. 
I consume approximately 2200-2400 calls a day and no longer work out as it was making me lose more. 
I started at 226 as a 5’7” female and I am presently 129.8 as of this morning unclothed. I do have quite a bit of extra skin as well. 
My BMI (which i think is a ridiculous marker of health) is 20.5 however I feel like I should not still be losing and I look ill actually. 
What are everyone’s thoughts on whether I should reach out to the dietician at the least to ask if things are going ok? I had labs drawn last week and all of my nutritional markers are WNL. 
Thanks!

Vegetables (raw) remain a problem for me. If I have a cup of salad, there is no room left to eat anything else. Eating 2 tbsp of veggies with lunch and dinner just doesn't seem worth the effort. 

I use to eat 1 pound of veggies a day on diet prior to surgery. It is not that I don't like veggies. I just can't seem to come up with a way to distribute 4 servings of vegetables through out my day along with my protein. I just get lazy and want to stick to yogurt, fruit, and protein shakes. I have talked to dietician twice, but didn't come away with practical ways to get in veggies. 

How to you eat your veggies? Specific sample menu of a day of eating would be really helpful.

For example, I use to have 2-3 cups of spinach with 1 cup of strawberries and 1 scoop of protein powder and 1 cup of water for breakfast before surgery, but that is way too much volume to eat for breakfast post surgery. Or I would have 3 eggs, onion, pepper, and tomato scrambled before surgery, but that too is too much volume for my stomach. If I try to alter it to 1 egg with a tablespoon of choppd veggies, doesn't seem worth the effort as that isn't even 1 serving of veggies.

One night I went out into the living room to ask my mom a question and I got an answer and headed back to my room. The very next day I had came out and asked the same exact question, in the same words, hand motions, tone of voice, head movements literally everything without realizing like I was an animatronic.  It’s important to note that I take meds and this happened right after I started a new medication which was 2mg of prazosin and we switched me from 300-250mg of seroquel and I take 10mg of fluoxetine.  After I asked the same question she said “you asked me that last night” I said “I did?” She said “yes, with same tone of voice hand motions and everything, that was kind of creepy.”  I had zero recollection of me ever asking her that question, which I agree with is very creepy.

29571,reddit.com,t3_1ovt4hu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovt4hu,Diabetic Foot Ulcer Story/Progression/At Home Wound Care,"I am not giving medical advice by all means but I wanted to make this post in hopes it may help guide someone struggling in one way or another. Everyone is different and you should always listen to a medical professional and get professional care when it comes to something as serious as an infected diabetic foot ulcer. My boyfriend (42) has had type 2 diabetes for around 3 years now. My boyfriend did not take it seriously, ate whatever he wanted, never checked his blood sugar, never performed foot checks, and was a heavy drinker. I could of done more research on it to try and help him but anytime I'd try to redirect him he would brush me off.

Fast forward to this year we had a vacation planned for the beginning of October. About 2 weeks before the trip, I noticed his foot looked extremely red and swollen. I asked what was going on with his foot and he said he had something wrong with the bottom of his foot and it had been like that for roughly 3 weeks. I scolded him for not saying anything to me and demanded he go to urgent care first thing in the morning. 

Urgent Care told him he had a badly infected diabetic foot ulcer and prescribed him antibiotics (doxycycline and cephalexin) and referred him to a podiatrist. I had a friend a few years back who was also a type 2 diabetic pass away when she was in her late 30s due to an infected burn she got from a heating pad and I instantly started to panic and tried to do as much research as I possibly could but there was not a lot of information online or photo documentation of the healing process of an infected diabetic ulcer. The podiatrist was not going to be able to see him until a whole week after the urgent care appointment which made me more anxious. 

I figured cleaning the ulcer and keeping it clean was the best I could do for the moment and took what I could from my online research. I used antiseptic soap to softly wash the foot/wound, rinsed with purified water, then rinse with saline spray, used a small amount of antibiotic ointment around and on the ulcer, covered it with a silver alginate dressing and then covered that with a sterile gauze and wrapped it up with the brown stretchy gauze. I always wore gloves and a mask to prevent any further contamination. I consistently did this everyday 2-3 times a day as there was a lot of discharge the first week and I made sure to lotion the rest of his foot with unscented lotion. I also put him on a strict high protien, low sugar diet and made sure he took his antibiotics and diabetes medication everyday on time. 

The ulcer seemed to be doing great after a few days and I was feeling so relieved that what I was doing was working. Then a couple days before his podiatrist appointment I started to notice what looked like a cut or athletes foot forming under his pinky toe. I began to panic again and blaming myself thinking maybe I accidently left his toe too moist or got lotion in between them. I began the same routine I did with the ulcer with the pinky toe of cleaning and dressing it. Even though the ulcer made a lot of progress the toe seemed to be getting worse very fast and he still seemed to not be feeling good (low-grade fever and tired). 

The day of his podiatrist appointment his toe looked absolutely horrible. The podiatrist came in and the first thing he said as he saw the foot across the room was ""That thing is probably going to have to come off."" He was talking about his toe and the side of his foot needing to be amputated. The podiatrist said ""If you had come to me a week ago, this would be a different story."" (Even though the podiatrist office said the soonest they could do was the appointment we had) We both looked at eachother in shock and sadness because of how serious this situation had become so fast. 

The podiatrist began peeling away the dead skin that had accumulated on his foot and noticed his foot began to bleed. The podiatrist then felt his foot and said ""Well you have a pulse in your foot snd it's bleeding which is actually a good sign that you still have circulation in your foot."" The podiatrist said I can send you to the emergency room right now and we can amputate the pinky toe and the fifth metatarsal or we can wait a week and see what happens. My boyfriend terrified of amputation opted to give it another week. The podiatrist said the reason the toe broke open and looked the way it did is because the infection must of spread upwards to his toe from where the infected ulcer was. I asked if we could try different antibiotics since it seems like it spread while on the current antibiotics. The podiatrist agreed and gave him different and stronger antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and clindamycin), ordered an MRI, gave him a medical boot for his foot, and had us make an appointment for the next week. 

I continued with my cleaning/wrapping routine about 2x a day for the next week, offloaded his foot as much as possible, and he immediately started the new antibiotics. In just a few days of the new antibiotics there was major progression and his toe finally started to look like it was getting better not worse. The next appointment with the podiatrist he said that the MRI showed that the infected did reach the bone and he had acute osteomyelitis in his 5th metatarsal with an abscess. The podiatrist was still recommending amputation but since my boyfriend was making a lot of progress, not feeling sick or tired anymore, and was tolerating the antibiotics he gave us the choice of waiting another week with the instructions of if he felt sick, had a fever, or pain to immediately go to the E.R. for amputation. Of course, we had to cancel our vacation and we kept up the same routine for another week and since there was less drainage at this point the podiatrist recommended only cleaning/wrapping once a day. 

Every week there was more and more progress and after about 3 more weeks the ulcer and the toe had completely closed up, and the podiatrist no longer recommended amputation. Fast forward to today, after 6 weeks of antibiotics (he's been off of antibiotics for 4 days), offloading, a protien rich/low sugar/low carb diet, keeping the foot clean and moisturized, the podiatrist believes his foot is in remission and remain stable. The podiatrist has lifted the restrictions, my boyfriend has lost 25 lbs, and we don't have another follow up for another month. There is a chance it may flare up again but the podatrist believes if we continue taking care of his blood sugar/diet, walking in moderation, and doing daily foot checks that his foot will make a full recovery.   

I took photos of my boyfriend's foot since the beginning of this journey in hopes it may help someone who is looking for guidance in what a diabetic foot ulcer looks like healing/getting worse. And I wanted to share what worked for my boyfriend in terms of at-home wound care for anyone who may be in our shoes now or in the future. Please if you have diabetes, try your best to check your feet everyday, take care of your blood sugar, and always go to the doctor as soon as you can if you notice any sort of ulcer, blisters, or cuts on your feet. My boyfriend is extremely lucky he didn't lose his toe, foot, or his life.

I take Alvedon regularly but it doesn't help much. The surgeon says that there is nothing wrong with it, but that some people have more pain than others.

Taking Wellbutrin and Lamictal daily, Testosterone injections weekly

Diagnosed with Bipolar II, OCD, GAD

Two nights ago I drank a standard IPA (9.9%), a tall boy IPA (7.5%), and some sort of piss water tall boy beer (surely no more than 5%). I downed 8 NyQuil and passed out. All of this was on an empty stomach, I hadn’t eaten in about 6 hours.

I woke up at some point incredibly high, I can’t even describe or really remember much about it other than panic. Passed out again, woke up yesterday morning and I was still quite high. Called out of work, spent the entire day trying to sleep it off. Woke up all throughout the night, still high. I’m now up and moving for work, I’m solid enough to be upright, but I still feel the NyQuil. I’m improving, but I might have to call out again.

Should I go get checked out at urgent care or the ER? I only haven’t because I feel like my symptoms are improving, just really really slowly. I am however a little concerned about any internal damage that may have happened. I had a bout of diarrhea yesterday and I haven’t tried to pass a movement since. I’ve barely eaten, I’m not hungry.

I never really used Reddit before, but I figured I would make a post and share some of my information and process from starting up to surgery so others may have more information as they explore their own journey.

Some stats are HW: 305, CW: 290, SW: ???, GW: ???. 32 yo Male. 5'9. Hyper Tension, Sleep Apnea, most recent labs showed some Pre-Diabetic symptoms

First, my process was FAST. I first requested some information on September 18th 2025. I went in-person just a few days later to get the process started. They told me I had to meet with a Nutritionist, get an EDG upper-scope, and pass the Psych Eval. I met with the Nutritionist on October 14th. I had the upper-scope done on October 30th. It was at this point they asked me if I wanted the surgery on November 19th. I had to decline because I have a direct work conflict and couldn't just change around my entire month for this. Lastly I completed my Psych Eval on November 6th. Now my surgery is scheduled for December 2nd. Essentially my process has taken me 2 months from initial consultation up to the surgery date if not for my work obligations. I do have to do some labs and complete a History and Physical in additional once all testing is complete. The Physical is November 17th, this upcoming Monday. 

Some OOP costs were the Psych Eval that cost me around $230. Additionally with my insurance I have to pay a 10% Coinsurance which brings my associated cost for the surgery to $2820. My Out of Pocket Max is $6k, which I am nowhere near meeting. Thankfully, a credit card will work. Had I had more time to plan and know the costs, I could have budgeted and saved. But the quick turn around definitely didn't allow for that. I have BCBS of Michigan through my state government job. They did not require any 6 month meeting with a nutritionist or previous weight loss attempts. I did have a letter from my PCP ready to go to advocate for me as we previously tried GLP's with no success, and then my insurance did not cover them at the top of this year. 

Regarding the decision of which surgery to get, I initially wanted the Sleeve. I feel like my weight has never been a huge negative aspect of mine, just who I was. When I met with the surgeon in the initial consult, she did recommend that I have the bypass. I inquired as to why that is, and essentially it boils down to she has found a lot of men around my age were most successful with the RNY over the Sleeve. She said that I can always change my mind, but I agreed with her to the RNY. As I looked for more resources, I found this (sub?)Reddit and began reading through it. It has been great to hear everyone's experiences both positive and negative and see the real side of things as they unfold. 

I hope to stay a bit active on this post and in this subreddit. My plan is have the surgery on the 2nd, take the rest of the week off work, then work remote throughout the end of the year. Thankfully my job can be done remote! I plan on sharing photos ranging from my heaviest weight to surgery weight and all the victories that come after. Happy to answer any questions ranging from normal to TMI to NSFW.

Stalls?,"I have my third follow-up appointment next week, but my team refused to give me a calorie range last time I saw them. Which I get, but I do need something to go off of and the answers online vary so wildly.

How many calories should I aim to eat daily? Like, a good range to stick within? Some days I’m only getting 700-800 but other days I’m all the way up past 1,000 at the end of the day but still hungry. I’m getting around 80g of protein (my team says minimum 60g) and like 60-80oz of caffeine free liquids. I’m in a pretty good stall right now (sigh), but I can finally add in exercise so I’m going to attempt getting into a walking routine after work. 

For some context, I had some complications post-op. Needed a few dilations, had some severe nausea, got better and finally cleared to exercise. Needed my gallbladder out like a week later. Had more complications from that, still dealing with those. Got mostly better, got Covid. Still sick, but well enough to move my body finally.

I was around 280lbs on surgery day and I’m hovering between 232lbs and 228lbs now. Starting weight was 320lbs, and I’m 5’7” and 24F. I haven’t really had a stall since 3-4 weeks post-op despite everything that’s happened so I guess my body chose now to start. Any good tips on breaking it? I’m guessing starting an exercise routine is a good place to start, but anything else? More water? More protein?

I just had the SADI-S surgery about a week and a half ago, my scale is telling me I’ve lost about 23lbs so far (and has stopped going down these past 2-3 days) which got me out of the 300’s!!! Which I’m very happy about!! 

But god I miss food so much. I feel so horrible admitting that, I’m very aware that’s what put me in this position in the first place. But the thought that I’ll never be able to enjoy a big bow of Mac and Cheese again makes me want to cry.

I did this because I knew it would force me to lose weight, I’ve been around 330lbs since I was 15 (22 now) and I know if something doesn’t change I’m going to die a lot sooner than I should. And not only that, there is just so much I want to do that I can’t, simply because I’m so big. 

But god I miss food so much right now. I miss the feel and the taste, almost like an addict who got out in rehab lol

But I do feel a bit unsure. I can sip water just fine, but when I sip on soup, I get this sort of odd feeling in my solar plexus, it's like when you've got like a bit of hiccup stuck in there. It lasts maybe 5 seconds and then goes away, but it's odd that it happens with my liquid meals and not water. 

The main thing that's worrying and what brought me here is, I was told to have 1/2 cup as the portion for my meals, and also that it's ok to sip water without waiting during the liquid stage. So the concern is why don't I feel full? I'm sipping water regularly and I'm ""eating"" my meals and milk snacks, but I don't seem to feel full. The closest I feel is that odd feeling I mentioned earlier, where it'll feel like I ate something heavy despite taking a tiny tiny sip, like definitely less than 1oz type of sip, but as I mentioned that just kinda goes away after 5 seconds. And I don't think it's an actual signal saying I'm ""full"" because I get the feeling even on an empty stomach when I have my morning meal before even touching my water, and now I'm just kinda anxious that I won't feel ""full"" when it comes to other foods eventually. 

So what's up with all this stuff so far? Is it just because I'm on liquids that I don't feel full?

I can’t get on any medicine to help until my stool sample comes back.  My work schedule makes it next to impossible to submit one.  So I’m working on that- I’m hoping they are open Tuesday, the one day I’m off.

Now to the story-
Immediately after my DS I had liquid diarrhea.  I was assured that it was because I was on protein drinks.  I moved onto soft foods and things got more solid.  I was comfortable- for a month or two.  Well, come the end of September and suddenly my number 2s start looking like the beginning AND I’ve become incontinent with them.   Every three-five days I quite literally crap the bed.   It is embarrassing and gross to clean up.   My stools have been like this since the end of September.
I also feel like I have to keep passing stool when I’m done.   Sometimes there actually is something else.   I began wondering if I had paradoxical diarrhea- where you are so constipated the diarrhea goes around the blockage to get out.   Had an XRay.  They said there is really no evidence of stool in my body.  

The Gastro suspects is caused by the DS- that the length is wrong on part of it or my pancreas just isn’t getting the signals and my digestive enzymes are not meeting the food at the right time.   She said once the stool samples are back she’ll try a medicine on me.

I guess one of my questions is can the Bariatrics doctor revise it so that the enzymes are hitting the food at the right time?  Am I stuck on medicine for life?

I am 62(F) and very overweight. I’ve struggled most of my adult life with weight. I started taking blood pressure pills that my pcp put me on about four years ago then a couple years ago I started having heart palpitations. Ended up going to a cardiologist. We did an echo and ct scan. Turns out I have 50-70% blockage in 2 out of 3 arteries. 

Now, I’m on heart and cholesterol meds. All my meds have fatigue as a side effect. I need to get a handle on my weight but I’m so tired after work and have no energy or drive. Now, I’ve gained more weight since my last appointment last March. Doc wasn’t happy and said he was fearful I may have a heart attack. He broached the idea of bariatric surgery after quietly berating me for my weight gain. Believe me, when I say quietly, I’m serious. He’s the most soft spoken doctor I’ve ever met. Then he quietly apologized for being blunt, lol. 

So, anyway, I’m gonna at least go through the prep program before making a final decision. I want to talk to people about their experience. What are the pros and cons? Was it harder than you thought it’d be? Was it easier than you thought it’d be? I love food so how was it psychologically to understand and grasp the concept that you will never eat food in the way you have always consumed it? Also, has anybody had any adverse experiences after surgery? I’m just scared. Excited to think I may be able to lose all this excess poundage that’s impeding my energy but scared that something terrible will happen post op.

I wanted to share my story and maybe get some perspective, because I’m honestly feeling frustrated right now.

My weight loss journey started back in October 2023, when I had a mild sleep apnea attack. The doctor told me point-blank — if I didn’t take action, I might not live long enough to finish college. He recommended bariatric surgery as the only real option, and my family and I went ahead with it.

Before surgery I weighed 143 kg, and food was my biggest comfort. Post-surgery, my life changed overnight. My portions went down to 1/10th of what I used to eat, and I started hitting the gym every single day.
By October 2024, I was down to 95 kg. I know some people think bariatric surgery is “cheating,” but for me, it was literally life or death.

Then came another huge setback — in November 2024, I met with a serious bike accident. Dislocated my left shoulder and tore my ACL on the right knee. My surgeon had already warned me that my recovery would be slow because of my limited food intake and nutrient absorption. I stopped gymming completely for months, but somehow managed to maintain my weight — no gain, no loss.

Fast forward to now — I got medical clearance two months ago and joined the gym the very next day. I train 5 days a week, doing 1 hour of weight training + 1 hour of cardio.
First month I ate 2 small meals a day (lunch and dinner) — no movement on the scale.
Second month I went OMAD (one meal a day) — still no movement.
I even tried a 3–4 day water fast, and my weight didn’t change at all.

At this point I’m seriously wondering where I’m going wrong. I’m doing everything “right” and still stuck. My motivation is dropping, and it’s stressing me out.

Has anyone else gone through this after major weight loss or bariatric surgery?
Is this some kind of metabolic stall?

Here I am sitting the Friday before my surgery this Tuesday. I am a former d-1 walk on. Italian kid from Jersey. Grew up on that good stuff this food is comfort. Italian pork sandwiches Chicken cutlets long hots cheesesteaks on Atlantic City or south jersey bread. That’s my stuff right there. I am 24 CW 487 but I never really looked that big. Always had that big guy athletic build but now w extra weight I put on since graduating college. I’m nervous man…. I wanna be able to go out to eat and enjoy food w the fellas…. Be able to keep my social lifestyle. I realize the whole point is to never go back. But just the idea of never ever being able to eat a normal plate of food again it rubs me the wrong way. I kinda masked those feelings until now. That is my WHY for getting healthy. To have a family….be around…..but also enjoy social scenes even more. Travel hop on a flight out to visit work friends in other cities and grub and have some drinks…. Go out in my current city w friends then enjoy a lazy Saturday w ordering food. Those are things I am battling with the prospect of FORVER giving them up. A life of only being able to eat 4 bites of food after I’m fully recovered does not sound worth it to me…… I’ve worked hard to get to this point but what it’s made me realize is perhaps I can do it myself w the help of GLP 1s.

I have this awful pressure that builds up inside that feels like gas but does not like to go away.

I've been in contact with my dietician and what I've been eating. I know most of what I've been eating can cause gas, but I've always been able to use GasX to relieve the pressure. I've been eating recipes that use ricotta cheese, cottage cheese, sweet potatoes, various beans, etc.  I've never had issues with any of these types of food before. The vitamin that I'm using has caused a bit of pain, so I paused it for a bit, but nothing ever really went away so I've started back on it.

It's been one month since surgery and this is the first time that there has been an issue. I'm finding that when I eat real food for protein, such as ground turkey or scrambled eggs, the pain is not as bad. So now I'm trying to find a variety of non-dairy products to eat that are still protein rich and sound appetizing. And I'm thoroughly sick of protein shakes, clear and milk based.

I have been given 12 medications I need to take at several intervals throughout the day and I'm just having a bit of a cry now I'm home. I haven't eaten anything since before the op. I can only stomach so much liquid, and all my liquid capacity is being taken up by trying to take my medication. 
I have been ok'd for the soup diet as of tomorrow but I still haven't had a sip of broth. 
The taste of the medication whether shotted or mixed in cordial is making me feel so sick even with the antisickness medication. My stomach is spasming constantly. I got the foamies and vomited them back up.

I don't know what to do. I'm tearful because I'm having withdrawals and I'm struggling because I can't bear the taste of some of these meds. 

Please can anyone give me advice on how you got past this hurdle with medication?

26030,reddit.com,t3_1oievfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oievfx/eds/,EDS.,"
Hi doctors,

I’m looking for guidance on how to go about getting evaluated for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) or another connective tissue disorder.

I’ve started connecting the dots, and I can’t shake the feeling that something important was missed my whole life.

As a kid, I was extremely flexible. I could bend in ways that made people cringe. Everyone just said I was “double-jointed,” but now I realize it might have been more than that.

My pregnancy history has been full of trauma and complications that still haunt me:
	•	My first pregnancy ended in an emergency C-section at 33 weeks. My son was born prematurely after sudden, unexplained complications.
	•	Just 15 months later, I had my daughter, and during a contraction, my uterus tore open on the operating table. It was life-threatening.
	•	About four years later, I had my youngest, and that was a trauma delivery. I was rushed to a trauma OR, needed blood transfusions, had an A-line placed, and doctors discovered a hole in my uterus the size of a navel orange. My placenta was acting as a cork, essentially keeping me alive until delivery.

Because of all that, I can no longer have children. The physical scars have healed, but the PTSD still holds me in a chokehold to this day. My OR time was just shy of 4 hours. I was fully awake the whole time. I remember a fog over the room. It was silent. My husband kissed my head telling me it was almost over. Now reflecting back he tells me how it was so loud and crazy in the room and i was white as paper. I knew if i closed my eyes i would never open them again. I am currently medicated and have seeked counseling and it’s gotten better. My youngest just turned 3 in September and as each day comes and goes my eyes open more to the danger my life was put in. I just threw away my care guide for my children i wrote the night before my delivery and it really raises flags as a mother for my daughters reproductive system. 

Recently, I found out that two of my little sisters have been diagnosed with EDS:
	•	One discovered it through back surgery, when doctors noticed abnormal connective tissue.
	•	The other went through hell trying to get answers, and I’m still not sure what route she took to finally get diagnosed but she is currently pregnant and seeing the same maternal-fetal medicine specialist I had.

All of this makes me terrified that this condition runs deeper in our family than anyone realized. I want to get properly evaluated, not just for myself, but for my daughters’ future. I never want them to go through pregnancy blind to a condition that could endanger their lives the way mine nearly ended.

My questions are:
	1.	Where should I start? geneticist, rheumatologist, or primary care?
	2.	If genetic testing isn’t easily accessible, can I get a clinical diagnosis based on my history and physical signs?
	3.	Are there any specific tests, imaging, or markers I should request?
	4.	How can I make sure my daughters are evaluated or monitored early on if this is hereditary?

I just need to know how to begin this process the right way. I’ve been dismissed for years, but now that I see the pattern in my family, I want to act before it’s too late.

Thank you for any guidance or direction you can offer 

I truly appreciate it.

Anyway, I checked my calories, protein, water foe the last week and it was all fine so it is just one of those things.

I decided I wanted to focus on something else so I decided to go for a walk on the days I work from home (2 to 3 days/week). I am really bad about stopping to eat and take 1/2 hour to move. I can have meetings literally from 8:30 to 4:30 with no breaks so it is important that I get up and move.

Back before surgery I had trouble walking 500 feet. The loop around where we live is .492 miles and I absolutely couldn't do that prior to surgery.

Today I did it! Twice. Each time less than 15 minutes! My knees still hurt so I don't think I could walk a mile without stopping. But I walked a mile today AND IT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL!!

Saturday 2 of my kiddos and I went to this trick or treat thing that was very steep hills and I did it with minimal trouble.

Anyway, I've been taking store brand Miralax daily with no relief, so the nurse suggested taking an extra dose in a warm liquid like coffee or tea, so I opted for peppermint tea because I was hoping it would also help soothe the pain in my stomach/guts. Well, it worked, sorta. This morning I had to jump out of bed and RUN to the bathroom. Good news: I had a BM. Bad news: it was diarrhea, which is what I was afraid of...

The nurse also suggested taking a Zofran before every ""meal"" to help with the nausea, but so far not even the Zofran is helping... 

Side note: according to the nurse, apparently my body is in ketosis right now which is causing my ketones that are stored in my fat to go absolutely ape shit which is why everything tastes weird and is making me ungodly nauseated... This shit sucks.

Anyway, so the nurse has suggested I go back to Phase 0 (clear liquids - but this time ONLY my clear proteinisolate, sugar-free popsicles, and sugar-free jello) for a few days to ""hopefully get hydration back under control"". I am devastated because I am SICK of liquids. I was supposed to be starting Phase 2 (purees) on Halloween, but now, idk if that's going to happen, and I'm feeling really fucking discouraged at this point... And I'm so sick of telling myself/hearing ""it'll all be worth it in the long run"" ... I KNOW! But right now it doesn't feel worth it. I just hate this all so much... 

I am supposed to go back to work Monday (already can't afford the extra 4 days I took off...), but I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm going to end up back in the hospital for dehydration, and that's one of my biggest fears at this point... 

Oh, and my birthday is on Tuesday, and I was going to mix a ""birthday cake"" flavored protein powder in with a vanilla shake, buuuut now I don't think I'll be able to handle it... so fucking yay for that too.

Anyway, if you read all of this rambling nonsense, I appreciate the hell outta you.

25377,reddit.com,t3_1odlebf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1odlebf/my_gastric_bypass_rny_looking_for_adviceother/,My gastric bypass RNY - looking for advice/other experiences around purees/soft foods,"Sorry about this being so long!   
  
I had my bypass on 9/8/2025, starting weight was 237, I'm 33F. My primary goal of getting gastric bypass was to address horrible constantly reflux I have dealt with for the past 5 years, and lose some weight. I am now down to 209 today. After surgery I was still experiencing quite a bit of reflux.   
  
A week after the bypass, I started experiencing a horrible sense of dread and terrible, awful back pain and vomiting with some purees. I ended up in the ER, and on 9/22/2025 I ended up having my gallbladder removed. I was supposed to start soft foods on 9/23 (and in the hospital, they were pressuring me very hard to eat soft foods, though I was only able to get some purees down. After the gallbladder removal my reflux has improved significantly. 

Since the second surgery though, I cannot eat soft foods and very few purees, and have had quite a few episodes of vomiting. I try a new soft food every day in hopes that it will improve, but I experience a sensation of ""stuck"" after I take about a 1/3 of a bite - now I know to stop here, or I will start vomiting. I chew very thoroughly, at least 30 times per that 1/3 bite (in terms of a normal size spoon, a small piece on the tip of it, or I'll use a spoon smaller than a baby spoon, we have some that are really little so it helps portion things). And with a food, if I don't feel the stuck feeling, it's nausea (dairy, beans, eggs &amp; any meat/fish give me nausea), and meat/fish &amp; eggs are the worst culprits of the stuck feeling (regardless if ""soft"" or ""puree""), though I have experienced this even with yogurt so it's hit or miss. I have attempted to eat very soft vegetables as well in thinner soups, think broccoli, a little piece of tomato, etc. They also cause this stuck feeling almost instantly. I have been able to get down thinned, beanless chili sometimes in very small servings. The soft ground beef is the only ""solid"" that does not cause this sensation.

Right now my daily food intake looks like this:   
2x orgain protein shake (one for breakfast, one for dinner)  
1 soft item, mashed potato (if I can tolerate it, often it makes me nauseous too) or chili  
Sometimes a low carb protein ice cream ""snack"" later on in the day if I can tolerate the dairy and if I am hungry. I realize potatoes are on the ""no"" list, but I am having trouble eating just about anything else, though sometimes I can't eat those at all either. Sour cream sometimes is okay in terms of nausea, so I'll add that to the potato or chili if I can, since I can only get a few small bites and it will add a bit more protein.  I do rarely have cream of wheat, but that also makes me nauseous at times.   
  
The other issue is water intake. I can't take a sip of water without feeling pain. I have to break my sips into what I would consider ""mini"" sips to be able to get the liquid down without pain. It's sip, swallow 1/3 or 1/2, then swallow the rest of the ""sip"". I have never been able to ""gulp"" which I think is due to my anatomy, and probably part of why I suffered from reflux in the way I did. Of course this makes getting 64 oz liquids down consistently difficult. I am able to take chewable vitamins as long as I get them down to a liquid texture before swallowing, and I am able to still take my levothyroxine, a very small pill. 

My question is, do others have this experience with puree/soft food, where it feels stuck? My doctor at 4 weeks said ""wait 2 more weeks and we'll see if you see improvements most people feel better at 6 weeks"". At my 6 week appointment on Monday, the NP said, well it might be 2-3 months for you to feel better, and you can't have a stricture because you still drink liquids fine. I'm just wondering if anything else can be going on, or if I should just wait it out, and want to know about others experiences? 

In addition to that, does anyone have any food suggestions, as I'm going a bit crazy? I've tried the ricotta bake with the same feeling, mozzarella cheese (which made me very very nauseous). In the past month I have had a single good soft food day where I was able to get down a few bites of mozzarella cheese with no stuck feeling or nausea (I think that was Wed of last week?) and back to the same problems the next day. If it will just take longer I understand, but I am also a little fatigued on trying to ""force"" it every day, experience this painful feeling in the hopes that something will be different that day? 

Btw, I am trying to advocate for myself with the medical team. At 4 weeks post RNY, the NP was very concerned and thought an endoscopy might be warranted. After talking to the doctor, she was talked out of it and said to wait. Again on Monday's appointment, they thought an endoscopy might be warranted, but after talking to the doctor, it was wait more. I am totally okay waiting longer if things just need to settle down, but I feel like I'm getting mixed messaging. 

As a side note, what happens when you lose all the weight you wanted to lose, but aren't getting enough calories to ""slow"" weight loss? I was hoping to get to 160, but if I have another month or two like this and can't get more calories in, I'm a little worried. 

Anyway, thank you for the help, I appreciate anyone who can talk to me about your experience and give me a little advice :) ",,,,2025-10-22 23:00:10.571476+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-10-22 21:40:11,1761169211,,"[""bariatric_surgery"",""dietary_modification"",""surgery_complications"",""meal_tolerance"",""quality_of_life""]","[""vomiting"",""nausea""]",[],[],[],"[""gastric bypass"",""reflux"",""vomiting"",""nausea"",""purees"",""soft foods"",""water intake"",""weight loss"",""food suggestions""]",borderline,0.6,,strong bariatric context with multiple symptoms,patient,0.9,"[""Symptoms"",""Bariatric Surgery"",""Diet"",""Care Settings""]",negative,,"[""frustration"",""anxiety""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""audience_anchor_patient_anchor_001"",""topics_bariatric_surgery_034"",""symptoms_nausea_020"",""symptoms_vomiting_020"",""topics_dietary_modification_035"",""topics_surgery_complications_040"",""topics_meal_tolerance_041"",""topics_quality_of_life_048""]",,3,"{""id"" : 14578, ""name"" : ""maxxeroo"", ""handle"" : ""maxxeroo"", ""gender"" : null, ""age"" : null, ""subscribers"" : null, ""created_at"" : ""2025-10-22T23:00:09.987034+00:00""}","{""id"" : 2, ""subreddit_name"" : ""gastricbypass"", ""description"" : null}"

25374,reddit.com,t3_1odftub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1odftub/the_1_most_effective_treatment_for_hypoglycemia/,"The #1 Most Effective Treatment for Hypoglycemia, is this...","Hi all. Biologist and lab researcher here to talk about the most effective treatment option for all 3 types of hypoglycemia.  (Post-prandial, nocturnal, &amp; fasting).  I'm looking for anyone that has tried it and if they could provide any feedback on their personal results.  

Other meds:  
We've all seen the GLP craze lately and have heard about ozempic, monjaro, (semaglutide, and Tirzapatide). Semaglutide has been around for 30 years the only new thing about it is the increased half life. These 2 compounds are available via RX and can help roughly 15-25% with glucose stability. Diazoxide is the current first line medication for hyperinsulinemia but it has side effects and doesnt work for 100% of people, it mostly treats fasting and nocturnal hypoglycemia with more mild benefits on reactive or Post-prandial types.

The medication I'm mentioning is the 3rd generation GLP1 drug and is called Retatrutide (GLP-R3, R10).  Officially this drug is finishing phase 3 clinical trials and will receive FDA approval by Q3 next year.  But unofficially 10s of 1000s of people have been on it now for several years.  It's widely available via online peptide sites, at physical locations like compound pharmacies, and shipped in bulk from overseas, mainly from China and India.  

How it works:  
Semaglutide and tirzepatide basically stop hyperglycemia, which has a rebound effect of stopping some but not all rebound lows.  They will work somewhat for you if your main issue is reactive hypoglycemia. Retatrutide stops the highs but also adds a 3rd receptor agonist stop the lows as well. 
When you drop low, your body releases glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones to stop the low as fast as possible.  Retatrutide activates the strongest hormone we have to stop lows, called glucagon. Its the same hormone that emergency hypoglycemic pens have in them.  But the pens downregulate and shut down your body from producing glucagon on its own for a time after its use, which is not good.    Retatrutide only activates your pancreatic alpha cells solely when your body detects a low, this mechanism is called glucose sensitive activation.  To sum it all up. Retatrutide will stop highs AND stop lows on a constant basis in over 96% of people, then on a long term basis it will use lipolysis to oxidize fat stores around your liver, kidneys, and pancreas, which in &gt;6 months, make them function better, your liver is directly involved in glucose stability, you'll regain more stability over time once your liver efficiency increases.  Then over time it corrects metabolic issues by reducing overall fat stores which drives insulin resistance, and finally it slows digestion along its route which acts as a buffer from instant caloric dumps from your stomach, smoothing out your glucose and insulin curves.  Theres additional beneficial mechanisms at play also but to keep this short I'll stop there.  I read studies as part of my job and reta is currently being studied in over 200 papers right now for everything from helping dementia to autoimmune conditions like graves disease. It is 100% NOT simply a diabetes/obesity drug. 

What this means for you:  
It means that in the very near future Retatrutide will be the first line medication used to treat many metabolic disorders including hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and reactive hypoglycemia.  It will be approved for diabetes and obesity first though.
It also means that if you don't care about getting it only via persciption, well then this peptide is available for you right now and if your symptoms are severe or your quality of life has been dramatically impacted, that you can literally restore your life in a matter of days and for only about $100-$120 per month. Which is kind of crazy.  

My personal experience:  
I have an insulinoma. I was having 30 or more hypoglycemic episodes per day in the 40s with occasional 30s.  I had seizures, hearing and eyesight damage, neuroglycopenia, and cognitive effects etc. I am currently being treated by Sloan Kettering. They did not prescribe me Retatrutide but are fully aware and watching my results on it.  I was prescribed diazoxide a high dose of 600mg/day by them (first line medication for insulinoma) and while it helped get me out of the 30s and 40s, it did not come even close to helping as much as Retatrutide did!  It quite literally saved my life.  

Feedback:  
If you have tried Retatrutide, please post up your experience here. Do NOT post where you got it from, do NOT ask for sources.  

Diaclaimer:  
I am not a doctor. None of this is advice. All discussion in reference to all GLP1s are for research and educational purposes only. Any future predictions are based on current facts and are not claims. Many statements and mechanisms have been oversimplified, to be easily understood by anyone reading this. You should not take Retatrutide or any GLP1 peptide if you are underweight. All GLP1s, including Retatrutide, will cause some degree of weight loss. Purchasing online or via compound pharmacies is without fda approval. Some doctors can prescribe it via a compound pharmacy but its rare and most have not even heard of this peptide yet.  You can not take a GTT, 72 hour fast test, or GLP-1 PET CT Scan if you are on any GLP1 peptide, it will interfere with the results by not allowing you to go ""low"" for the test.  Always consult a doctor before changing any of your medications or adding any. By reading all the way to the end of the small print, you consent to giving this post a nice big thumbs up or to mailing the OP a sizable check, which option chosen is at the sole discretion of the reader.

Recently, I came across a site called ucofo where you can look at different weight loss treatments side by side. It doesn’t sell anything; it just lists information clearly so you can compare what’s out there.

I got my Bypass surgery in mid- December 2022. My weight on surgery date was 360lbs. My current weight is 191lbs (25f, 5’7”). I feel disappointed in myself that I haven’t lost enough weight and that I seem to not to be able to lose more. Sometimes I feel like I eat too much. For example, when I eat pasta I can eat ~5oz of pasta and maybe like 2oz of chicken on the side. I love pasta so I genuinely cannot force myself to stop eating it. I can also eat an entire pb&amp;j along with ~20oz of a protein shake. It takes me 1-1.5 hours to finish the shake + sandwich. I will also eat a few snacks, which usually consist of some type of junk food. There are certain foods that I can’t eat much of which is so interesting. I can only eat 1/2 a McDouble in one sitting along with half a small fry and 2 nuggets, or 1/5 of a chipotle bowl. I feel like the problem also has to do with the fact that I drink when I am eating so my stomach is most likely larger than it should be at this point (I can eat + drink 12oz in 1 sitting). I’ve always needed to drink when I eat, so I truly cannot stop myself.

I was placed on birth control due to a medical condition halfway through last year and since then, I have been struggling to lose weight the most. This is when I seemed to have hit a plateau. Since then, my weight has been fluctuating from 185-195 and I have not been in the 180s since the beginning of the year.

Since my doctor noticed I have been at a steady weight for over a year, she recommended loose skin removal. I had loose skin removal on my thighs 5 months ago and even then there was no noticeable weight loss from the loose skin removed. In December I will be getting a panniculectomy to remove my excess belly. However, I am just not happy with myself and the results of my surgery so I am stressed about getting the surgery and still being so big.

Living alone allows you to concentrate better on your meals and goals, but you may lack support in moments of weakness or frailty. 

Living with others provides you with that support and encouragement, but seeing all those delicious dishes paraded in front of you and distracting you from your goals may not be such a good thing.

And the second question.

We all know that the vast majority of social gatherings revolve around food, drink, or both.

How do you handle these social gatherings, especially in the first few months? Do you bring your own food? Your own bottle of water or smoothies?  I understand that after several months, things may normalise a bit, but even so, it's still a good social reset.



All this comes because I think that few people are afraid of the operation itself, but rather the change that comes afterwards.

I will absolutely be deleting this once I calm down. So, either keep scrolling or read fast.

I’m at the point where I’m letting others advocate for me because I’m done. One doctor who isn’t even my surgeon reached out just to check on me. Meanwhile, the surgeon who’s operated on me six times can’t be bothered. Not him, not the four other providers in his office I’ve seen since 2018. If he’s in surgery or off for the day, I don’t exist.

My primary care doctor is incredible. She checks on me daily, contacts my insurance, and does more than most specialists ever would. I’m beyond grateful for her. But she can only do so much.

Dr Sharp, the one who could actually make a difference, is missing in action. He seems to think I’m not getting better because I just won’t eat enough, even though his own nutritionist told him that’s not the issue.

Let me ask you, Dr Sharp. Would you be excited to eat solid food, low sugar, low carb, high protein, if it meant vomiting and shitting the bed afterward? Especially with a broken washer? Wouldn’t you want to know why that’s happening instead of just telling me to eat more?

I was on TPN from June to October. It gave me two bacterial infections and severe sepsis. It’s no longer an option. During my sixth surgery in August to untwist my stomach, you also gave me a G-tube. Now there’s a painful growth coming out of it. I can flush it, but feeds aren’t possible until that’s addressed.

I sent pictures to your office Friday morning. The response was “he’s in surgery then off for the day, take Tylenol. No PA is comfortable giving you anything else.” Also “go get blood cultures.”  

Guess they forgot I’m homebound and just had clear cultures on the 10th.

Also, I see a liver specialist because of you. My liver enzymes have been over 1000 for two months straight. I was hospitalized Sept 14 to 19 for that and muscle weakness. No explanation from imaging. Just “maybe it’s an infection from your last 20-day stay.” And yet you tell me to take more Tylenol, which is toxic to the liver.  

I saw you Oct 2 I was admitted later that day with serve sepsis and in hospital till Oct 10, I had severe sepsis from two blood infections. But my liver enzymes were high before that. That day you told me I felt terrible because I was refusing to eat what I needed to sustain my nutrition. Thanks Doc. 

Back to Friday. Your office refused to help because you left after surgery. But somehow Dr Bermuda put in the blood culture order. So someone was available.  

And what’s so uncomfortable about prescribing steroid cream? If all the PAs are uncomfortable, there are four other doctors in the office. Ask one.

You expect me to return to work Nov 1 without any physical or occupational therapy. You marked a terrifying diagnosis in my chart but gave me zero education, so I had to Google it and now think I’m dying. Thanks for that.

I’m taking in 400 to 500 calories a day. I’m already malnourished per labs and visibly wasting muscle. But sure, let’s pretend this is just about me not trying hard enough.

I have a case management appointment Thursday. Months ago, I was advised to file a grievance with the medical board and accept medical aid. I held off because I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I just wanted the aftercare I deserve. But I’m at that point now. Everything is documented. MyChart messages, recorded calls, labs, imaging. I know how to self-advocate. I know the system. And I’m done playing nice.

This is the last thing I want to do. I know people who’ve had great experiences with Dr Sharp. I don’t want to take that away from anyone. But his office needs an overhaul. I deserve to move on with my life. If they won’t help me, I’ll use every tool I have to help myself, even if that means there are consequences.

This isn’t impatience. Since June, I’ve been out of work after my fifth surgery. I’ve battled this office daily. I’ve written step-by-step instructions for insurance referrals. I’ve done their job while trying to recover.

I've been having some crazy dizzy spells, when I get up from places. Then I feel numbness from my head down. I stop, recover and I'm fine afterwards. 

I've been taking my vitamins, drinking water  and also eating as much protien possible.  I still have protien shakes. 

With that said, all I've been wanting to eat is frozen cold fruit but I know to get my protien in regardless. All my blood work came out ""normal"". A1c, B12, everything and I mean everything was fine. 

My doctor said it's my body adjusting, that my blood pressure is proof of this seeing it's super high then super low and vice versa. 

Has anyone experienced something like this in the past, if so any suggestions to stop them? Or is this something that will pass in time?  TIA! 

(I'm 3 months post-op and have lost 50lbs since July1 and see my surgeon on the 28th)

Yesterday I had a very long morning, felt pretty ragged, on top of that skipped breakfast and came home at 11 for a phone interview.  While I was on the phone I ate a sandwhich, and finished it when I got off the phone.  I could tell I ate too quickly and I did not feel good.  I laid down but my husband kept bothering me on his lunch break.   I laid there stressed out.  Around 2pm I had a bright idea to eat a tortilla with some turkey and melted cheese on it... Obviously I was stress eating.  Really didnt feel well after that, and infact an hour later it must have hit the intestine or the next step in the process.. I was in so much pain I couldn't move and was nearly in tears.  Felt like every organ in my body was under so much pressure it was going to explode.  In my mind it had to have caused long term damage because of how badly it hurt.  It was until SEVERAL hours later I got some relief and started farting like crazy, for hours.  The pain didn't go away until about 7pm, and it was all explosive gas.  The gas is a real problem for me I don't know what to do for it.  Maybe take beano every day?  I don't know but I am now afraid to eat, especially bread, I know I made a bad food decision yesterday and I never want to feel like that again, it caused me not to get anything done and my throat is sore from trying to throw up which I cannot do since GB.

I gained 100 pounds. I've always been in the 200-240 range at 5'10"". Never much cared about being curvy. But now I'm in a place where I can't do enough physical therapy to lose the weight after every injury and/or surgery as I have EDS things are going to keep causing issues. 

Lately my legs hurt so bad I can barely get through my exercises. When my doctor told me I needed to add an hour of cardio on top of the hour of PT I do already I was mad because there aren't enough hours in the day and if there are I don't have the spoons (energy) to do much because of comorbidities. 

I've only had heart burn once in my life so I was going to go with a sleeve but now that I've been reading this forum I think I'll end up with the bypass... if I go through with it. I'm nervous because I was on a 1500 calorie diet for six months with no movement, then they put me down to 1200 a day and nothing, then they blamed it on my perimenopause (I'm 50), so I broke down and charged Ozempic on my credit card for six months and gained 6 pounds!!!! That's when my primary doctor suggested surgery. I said no at first but now I'm meeting with the doctors to decide if I'm going to go through with it. 

I would love to hear from anyone but especially if you were around my size, I'm worries about sagging skin as I already have HS and get rashes under my boobs and apron. My insurance won't pay for skin removal surgery and when I gained the 100 pounds I went from a D cup to an I cup so that is a bigger concern of mine.

That’s the easy part. I’m getting enormous pushback from my significant other. To the point that if I don’t bail, there won’t be a significant other. I can’t even believe I’m in this situation. 

I’ve struggled with weight most of my life. It’s not just diet as I have multiple autoimmune diseases (4 confirmed plus one more half confirmed), stage 2 NASH in my liver, sleep apnea and still recovering from neuro Lyme disease. 

I did lose a lot of weight, about 50 lbs. I was 330 and now at 280. Last year on wegovy and this year on mounjaro helped keep me at this weight but that’s it. When insurance stopped Wegovy I gained back 20 lbs while on the low does of mounjaro. It’s only been at the 12.5 dose that I made any progress to get back to where I was last January. 

And both these drugs are killing me gastro wise. Half the week diarrhea the other half constipation. 

The surgeon knows and I’m sticking to my pre op diet and pre surgical testing and they scheduled an appointment via zoom to talk to both of us on Thursday but I know that will be blown off. I’m 59 and not looking forward to giving up half of what I spent my whole life working for so I’m just watching this candle of hope sputter into darkness. 

So I have to decide to do the surgery and lose everything or bail and lose all the work I put into this and years off my life and what I worked for all my life. 

Either way I totally lose.  Anyway I just want to vent. I’m not looking for comments or anything. So those who succeeded , congrats. To those that had complications and still struggle, I know you can do it. If nothing else use my ordeal to keep trying.

The first 2/3 months were the hardest! Once you pass the 3 months finish line, things get better in terms of eating portions (or they should do).

Dumping will always happen when you get too sugar happy - you will tolerate sugars more as time goes on but the Dumping (my version of it is wanting to puke but nothing coming up except sugary liquid) is not worth thr hassle of a sweet treat.

I can eat a more now but thankfully haven't gained much weight, the few KG I did gain was from starting hormone therapy (testosterone). 

Loose skin in some areas has now stopped me from still dressing the way I want.

I didnt take my vitamins daily as seriously, I still struggle with this but did eat foods rich in protein and vitamins. 

GAS! oh my god, I dont leave the house in the morning until I've had my morning dump in fear that I'll actually shit myself should I need it when im out. I can no longer hold in a number 2 at all!!! 
Also, when I've had too much sugar, the farts are disgusting, I cannot take the smell, this is probably the only downside after 18 months. The rest I can tolerate. 

Sometimes my stomach still feels funny when eating certain foods or if my stomach just isn't in the mood to eat 🙃.  

If I've missed anything, I'll edit this.

I'm a 28F (CW:210)who has been overweight my entire life. I was born with Hashimotos disease which causes me to have a slow metabolism, fatigue, anxiety, depression and digestion issues (amongst other things)
For context, I grew up with a mom who suffered from ED as a teen and was very judgmental of my body and restrictive with my food from  a young age. I've always been ~60lbs overweight my entire life and it has taken a serious toll on my mental health. From a young child I was put on diets, taken to nutritionist and signed up for the gym at 13. As an adult I've kept up an active life and overall healthy diet, and its never enough. My doctor advised I was eligible for VSG surgery due to my BMI of 30. She consulted with a bariatric surgeon that advised VSG can help with fertility (i want to have kids in the next 5 yrs) 
I feel a lot of shame about the topic but thats from my childhood and overall experience around being overweight.
My thoughts are, I want to live a healthier and happier life and to be there for my husband and future kids for as long as I can.
I guess what I'm looking for is some guidance from people who understand the mental strain weight can have. I haven't told my husband or mom that I'm thinking about it.

That being said, now that it's finally here, I am already slacking. I got used to relying on just those, and now I have no idea how to get the 60-80g she wants me to get from just food. I'm unfortunately picky, and some of the things that would give me protein (nuts and seafood specifically), I can't stand. I can't afford to just buy meat every single day and make meals to meet my protein goals, and meal prep is out because I can't eat any kind of meat that's been warmed up. It makes the taste disgusting to me. Eggs are hit or miss on whether they upset my stomach or not.

I also just plain don't have hardly any appetite at all since surgery. I don't eat meals. I graze. I'm lucky if I eat twice in one day, and that's if I force myself to. She said I should be eating 4 oz of protein and 4 oz of veggies during meals. Eating when I'm not hungry is what got me into this mess in the first place. I don't want to fall into old habits again. How do you all meet your protein goals with food? Any tips or recipes you care to share? I don't want to not get enough protein. I'm thinking about doing at least 1 shake a day so I know for sure I'm getting at least 30g. I should also point out that my plan doesn't allow for breads, pastas, potatoes, corn, peas (grains or anything starchy) until month 6.

I’ve wanted to post in here for so long with my progress, but never felt like I made the scale move as much as some of you all. Aside from the first couple months, it’s been a slow road to me. I haven’t gained weight, but I sometimes go months without losing anything. That being said, I still feel my body changing. Earlier this year, I started cycling, and to date have ridden nearly 1100 miles. Despite the stagnant scale, I see clear changes in my clothes and my legs. Just last month I started resistance training. My last scan stated I had about 219lbs of lean body mass, so I don’t think I’ll be joining any of you in ONEderland anytime soon. BUT - I feel amazing. I feel capable. I feel strong. Just a month ago, I rode my bike 45 miles, a feat many of my fitter friends couldn’t even accomplish. This month I’m going to do a 100k bike ride, which is about 62.5 miles. Then next spring, I’ll be attempting 100 miles. Sure, you might see my current weight and know I have a ways to go - but that doesn’t discourage me in the least. At my heaviest I got winded just taking a shower. If you have any hesitation about getting surgery, this is your sign. When your at your least healthy point, it’s so easy to rationalize and tell yourself you’re fine - but I didn’t realize how much my weight was actually holding me back from my potential, until I lost it. To me, the number on my scar no longer matters. It’s about I how I feel. 

Best of luck to everyone out there working hard on being a better version of themselves. WLS is not the shortcut people think it is, this is hard a$$ work - and what you’re doing is worthy of respect - don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

I've had a Sleeve Gastrectomy four months ago. Life changing, have dropped 30kg so far, and maybe 20 to go.

I was surprised there wasn't a subreddit already but I guess most people having this procedure are a little older? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Please post your progress, whats good, what's bad. What have you learnt?

For me it's been life changing. Sleep aponea - gone. Sore knees - gone. Fat face - gone. Jeans I have from 20 years ago - now fit. 

I'm feeling healthier and fitter every day, but am still worried about long term nutrition, and general day to day well being.

Would love to meet more people who have gone down this path, and your reasons why, benefits you've had, and any problems you've had.

Today is my first day full packets (6 of those suckers) let me tell you it has been.. something.. I recieved 7 boxes of different ""meals""

Today's meal line up 
Oatmeal
Vanilla shake 

Vanilla shake
Pinapple orange drink

Cream of chicken soup
Andd salted caramel chocolate

I put different packets together to ensure a variety throughout the meals. I was not a fan of the Vanilla. I followed both directions to try it in different forms, as the shake and pudding . . I love pudding so i figured that was going to be the winning preparation method. . Boy was I wrong. I did not like it, it wasn't a great flavor, maybe think noticeably diet cake batter, super heavy in the artificial sweetner taste and pudding method (breakfast)left it super sticky slime texture. After every bite or sip (in shake form for lunch) i would get yuck goosbumps. A few hours went by and I decided I would have the chicken soup(dinner) since I already tried that one previously, it was the best one, not great but most tolerable. I was to drink the salted caramel soon after but I skipped it. I was pretty full and drinking an additional serving would most likely enduce vomit. I have been working hard to drink plenty of water. I think I was so stuffed because of it. So fast forward 2 hrs to my sons bedtime. We brushed out teeth and used mouthwash after. I lay woth him until he is asleep, Since then ive had a stomach ache. I wonder if it was from skipping that last packet, or maybe the mint after taste churned my stomach up. ..OR it was the pudding from hell .. today had been tough ive heard day 4 is even more difficult.

1. I dont know where to start
2. I have POTS and am Iron deficient.
3. I'm a picky eater.
4. I have ADHD and routine is so hard to keep.
5. I start my work day around 6am and by the time I get off im tired.

I've had a pretty intense year aside from the surgery itself. It's no excuse, but I have been lacking a lot, and would appreciate some advise or maybe some useful tools to help me get back on track. Ever since my mother passed away in March this year, I've been struggling. 

I still stay as consistent as I can for my vitamins and calcium, but I don't have much motivation to eat. NGL, even though I don't have any regrets getting the surgery, I don't find much joy in eating anymore. Especially since I got prescribed my Ritalin back in May. It does make me sad. I was an emotional eater for so long, and losing my mother, my first go-to was to eat. But I couldn't even do that without vomiting, because I was still in the healing stages of my post op.

26f

Currently Day 11 of the pre-op liquid diet, which has gone surprisingly smooth thus far.

But I'm having doubts about getting the gastric bypass. I see a lot of posts online (not just reddit) about how more people are sticking with the GLP-1 route. I've been on GLP-1's for almost **three years** (3 different ones too) and have gotten 35lbs down that route, (20lbs natural, 35lbs with glp-1) but still have a good 100lbs to lose and am not sure that even with the GLP-1's I'll get there. (I have not gone up to higher/loss doses of GLP-1's either, mostly maintenance doses as that was what my doc recommended - 0.5mg etc. so, there is still a lot of room for higher doses I have not maxxed that out).

I'm concerned about reactive hypoglycemia post-op too, as I struggle with blood sugar drops already (GLP-1's have helped).

Is RnY the best route? Or should I push more with GLP-1's especially now that more options are coming to market?

Does anyone regret having the bypass instead of going the GLP-1 route?

Really struggling with this, any advice/insights appreciated.

Edit 10/7/25

Thank you all for your input it has really helped! I'm feeling a lot more confident about getting the bypass, as I am really looking for a more permanent fix. Having the option to even add a GLP-1 back in later on makes me feel more comfortable too.

Seriously, thank you for taking the time to respond to my post. Definitely helped to talk me off the ledge.",,,,2025-10-08 11:13:02.492371+00,8,0,null,en,24,2025-10-06 17:48:43,1759772923,,"[""bariatric_surgery"",""treatment_failure"",""access_coverage""]","[""hypoglycemia""]","[""semaglutide"",""tirzepatide"",""dulaglutide"",""liraglutide""]","[""reactive_hypoglycemia""]",[],"[""gastric bypass surgery"",""liquid diet"",""glp-1 route"",""35lbs down"",""blood sugar drops"",""reactive hypoglycemia"",""permanent fix"",""maintenance doses""]",borderline,0.6,,"strong bariatric context, but only one minor symptom (hypoglycemia) and condition (reactive_hypoglycemia) without explicit PBH mention.",patient,0.9,"[""Symptoms"",""Treatments"",""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Bariatric Surgery"",""Access & Coverage""]",mixed,,"[""anxiety"",""hope""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""topics_bariatric_surgery_034"",""audience_anchor_patient_anchor_001"",""topics_treatment_failure_046"",""treatments_semaglutide_028"",""treatments_tirzepatide_029"",""treatments_dulaglutide_030"",""treatments_liraglutide_031"",""conditions_reactive_hypoglycemia_009"",""symptoms_hypoglycemia_016""]",,56,"{""id"" : 7060, ""name"" : ""zern101"", ""handle"" : ""zern101"", ""gender"" : null, ""age"" : null, ""subscribers"" : null, ""created_at"" : ""2025-10-08T09:12:35.251011+00:00""}","{""id"" : 2, ""subreddit_name"" : ""gastricbypass"", ""description"" : null}"
21891,reddit.com,t3_1nzsg7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1nzsg7w/puree_full_liquid_phase/,Puree / Full Liquid Phase,"Hi Everyone

I am a little over 1 week post op/RNY. I am in week 3 of the puree/full liquid phase. I've made quite a few adjustments to my diet and lifestyle during this journey that have been difficult. Adjusting to a low-carb diet, eliminating caffeine (my program is strict on caffeine during the first six months), and avoiding carbonation, among other things. T

Those were challenging as it is, but the puree phase has definitely proven to be the most challenging. I think it is in part due to how restrictive the diet is and how long it's required. An important note I've had to remind myself is that this is only 4 weeks of my entire life and will be worth it in the long run.

That being said, I don't see too many threads in here talking about how to manage during this phase so I wanted to drop down some of my go-to ""meals"" and some of the tricks I've picked up along the way. The sweet proteins like shakes, smoothies, etc. are pretty easy just because there's so much variety available that it doesn't take too much planning. The hard part is finding good savory options. I know that a lot of people recommend the protein added bone broth to sip, but I found myself needing a lot more variety and substance. I tried a lot of the canned soups from the store but I only lasted a couple of days on those before I started feeling depressed lol.

I've found that there is a lot of trial and error during this phase, and I just wanted to share what I've learned and hope that it helps anybody who may be struggling to find satisfying meals that are in line with the plan. Also as a preface, always make sure to follow your practice's specific guidelines, as they may be different. My program outlines that the full-liquid/puree diet is the same 2 weeks pre-/post-op.

Feel free to contribute your tips as well.

Tips:

* Serve your pureed items in a bowl. This sounds overly specific, but the first couple of times, I just poured it into a glass cup and sipped it. I've found that it is better, mentally, to eat it out of a bowl with a spoon. Makes it feel more normal.
* Canned chicken is very flexible for this phase. It is relatively cheap and it purees very well.
* Chicken, in general, I've found purees much better than other proteins.
* Canned tomato/pasta sauces are a lifesaver. Look for the low-carb bases. There are good marinara sauces and just plain tomato sauce.
* Ricotta cheese adds good flavor and texture to pureed recipes. You can make a puree/soup that tastes very close to lasagna if you add the right tomato sauce and protein.
* Refried beans (look for the high fiber/lowish net-carb options), when combined with ""taco"" ingredients (chicken, veggies, etc.) puree well and come out looking and tasting just like refried beans with more flavor and protein. You can also add sour cream, and that works well, too.
* Look for those pre-marinated and/or pre-cooked meats. The ones that can be microwaved. They're usually already pretty tender and puree well.
* Chicken stock adds a bit of protein and helps with pureeing foods
* Ground meats (turkey, beef, etc.) don't puree very well. In my experience, it comes out gritty and has an unappealing texture.
* Canned tuna - no, just no, don't even try it. It's not worth it. Promise.
* If somebody suggests ""try a cheeseburger puree"" Do not heed this advice; the results will make you cry.
* Cottage cheese can be added to a puree for texture and flavor, but tastes a bit..weird, by itself
* Variety, variety, variety. Mix it up, keep it fresh. The last thing you want is to get sick of something you enjoy while you are sustaining an incredibly restrictive diet.
   * If you have to, avoid your favorite protein shakes and whatnot one week before your puree phase. I guarantee you'll get your fill of them during this time.

I am getting BARI-Surgery in a month or so, and I have to stop smoking for the surgery and just to have a new healthy way of life- and I am ready for the change. Change is SO necessary at this point in my life, I had a near-fatal car accident in a bad rain-storm 1.5 years ago.. This left me permanently disabled and also caused me to gain 70 pounds due to health issues caused by complications after the wreck.

Anyways, in order to get to walking more and get out of a being in a wheelchair most the time- I am getting RYN bypass or the SADI-s surgery to lose some weight- I need to lose around 125 pounds..

I have done my entire checklist for pre-surgery stuff EXCEPT the nicotine/cotineine test.. which I have my final visit with the doctor to decide which of the 2 surgeries I will undergo, and this appointment is on Wednesday next week in 5 days.... AND OBVIOUSLY I will not pass a test in 5 days, being that I just threw my final nicotine vape away last night.. but I believe they are not actually testing me until 2 weeks before surgery @ my pre-op lab tests appointment..

MY DOCTOR actually never mentioned the nicotine thing after my very first visit/ consultation back at the beginning of February this year... He asked if I am a smoker, and I lied and told him I had quit in January but (I switched a lower nicotine vape and I was trying at the time to stop).. Then Doctor told me that I needed to be nicotine free for surgery so I needed to stay stopped.. He gave me all my ""6-MONTH CHECKLIST"" ITEMS: which were 6 monthly nutrition visits, 2 sets of full panel lab-work, a colonoscopy, AND endoscopy,

After the things listed above the doctor will either clear me to schedule surgery OR deny/add things to my checklist. WELL HE CLEARED ME!!!! ONLY THING LEFT IS I have the final visit with the doctor to decide which of the surgeries I will be getting in 5 days next Wed!!!!!!! I am going to go for the RYN-Bypass OR SADI... (not getting sleeve.)

but im confused because the nicotine thing was a part of my checklist, right below the labs, and he said he checked all my lab work and he cleared me for surgery- so I am unsure if he is going to like test me the day of surgery, or @ my final visit with him Wednesday, OR not at all and he just was advising me to be nicotine free. I don't know

\*\*\*I KNOW THAT I WAITED TOO LONG- WHICH IS A TYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF SOMEONE ADDICTED TO NICOTINE, WAITING UNTIL IT IS absolutely NECESSARY TO QUIT\*\*\* 

I decided to do the Chantix route, due to failing @ cold-turkey quitting. I did try the non-nic vaping route and that failed due to having extreme gas pain with it and also really bad heart burn/reflux more than I already have and that was not bearable for me. SO Chantix was my last-ditch effort or whatever that saying is HAHA..

21827,reddit.com,t3_1nys53c,https://i.redd.it/355vrzhugbtf1.jpeg,Running out of jeans 😅,"As of tomorrow I will be 8 months post-op! Prior to surgery, I had a big storage tub of pants (mostly jeans) in sizes US18-12 from previous weight loss in which I’d gotten down to 190 at my lowest. Now I’m flirting with 170 and feel like I’m nearly out of options that fit decently or at all.

Like some things I could belt but my calves are still rather thick and these are mostly skinny/mom/boyfriend jeans, so they end up weird and baggy through the thighs and at the knees.

But…is it safe to buy new pants? I don’t want to invest in clothes that won’t fit next year. But! I also know there’s usually something of a rebound that happens after hitting your lowest, so WOULD they fit again eventually? 

Should I just get some secondhand for now? I was a little disheartened last time I was in a big thrift store that they didn’t have a fitting room, because that dysmorphia’s got me good and I no longer have any concept of what clothes that will fit me look like (I recently tried on some jeans I got a while ago from an Australian brand and had miscalculated the size difference, ending up with what’s allegedly the equivalent of a US8, and now what felt comically small are only a bit snug, which seems absolutely bonkers to me!).

Or maybe I just go for leggings and elastic waist stuff for now? I was always a bit averse to them when I was heavier because I felt like I needed the structure, but I’m getting over it a bit and I mostly work from home anyways. I just worry even fleece lined leggings won’t be warm enough in the winter unless I double up.

Sorry for rambling, I just like to hem and haw about things to avoid what I’m supposed to be doing. 

TL;DR:
How long after surgery is it worthwhile to buy new clothes?

(Also is it at all worth trying to get anything taken in?)

Does anyone have any recommendations for exercises that can help build muscle but are gentle on the body? I will only be doing body-weight movement for a while given how little muscle I have right now…

I eat onions and cilantro and all kinds of food. I can tell I get “full faster” but not the “oh I had 3 bites and I’m full” like I see people talk about all the time. I struggle getting protein in and I know there are things that I could do to help but with everything that has happened this year it’s been really hard.

On a side note, im curious to see if other women had this issue. I've always had issues with my period, I can go for months without it and it seems to only be triggered by severe weight loss, did anyone experience this?
