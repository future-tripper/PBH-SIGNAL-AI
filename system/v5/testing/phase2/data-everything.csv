My goal has been 110 LBs but I've been stagnating around 180-190 for a whole year despite the walking and minor lifting I do thanks to my job.   
I have PCOS, which admittedly makes melting the fat off SO hard with constant unhealthy cravings due to crashes and hormonal instability. I'm currently aiming for something a bit smaller (165 LBs) by the end of winter if I can push hard enough, and if that's possible to lose 30 in like what, 4ish months?

Big struggle is upper thigh, hip, and stomach fat. I don't want a 100% flat stomach because that's not ideally too healthy. Got to have some fat to protect internal organs but I want to get slim enough to be able to wear cute clothes and not feel gross when I go outside. I've been making some dietary changes with 0 sugar drinks (0 sprite with a mio and also sparkling ice is my go-to rn) cupping out chips for low-cal stuff and rice cakes, and I'm actively trying to replace candies and baked goods with low sugar healthier options (I do have a while bag of chewy sweetarts in my room but those are for in moderation)

I've taken some tips from other sites/subs about weight loss and diet fixing but I want more advice, all the advice, every weird little tip and trick and secret that'll finally make me happy, yknow?

32799,reddit.com,t3_1ph9rh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ph9rh8/its_really_sticking/,It's really sticking.,"Just wanted to share my story because I can't tell anyone (keeping my weightloss intentions to myself) but I want to celebrate myself.

I (34F) have posted here a few times before. I've tried to lose weight many times by calorie counting and exercise, and it was always the same pattern: I lose 5 kg, am happy, I plateau, I am sad, I eat, I give up, I gain it all back and more. We all probably know this fun ride 🙃

I lost my job in August 24 and fell into a huge depressive hole. In December 24 I decided that I should at least use the copious amounts of time I have and get my shit together. I weighed myself, 86kg. For reference, a healthy weight for me would be around 72kg or less.

So I splurged on a gym membership for 6 months (thank god for healthcare benefits) and started tracking once again. I lost like 4 kg by March 25 and built muscle. It was slow, but it was working. Then, depression hit again. I had to get disability benefits due to my burnout and other conditions making me unfit to start work again, and I felt goddamn awful. One of the lowest points of my life. Still no job. No perspective. Only depression. I stopped tracking and working out.

In June 25, 3 months had passed. I knew I had let myself go and hadn't been kind to my body. So I weighed in. Gained ""only"" 1.5kgs. And spite hit me. Shit, I thought, I can NOT do this again. I can NOT keep being so negligent with myself. I need to do this now. It may take ages, but it needs to stick.

I wrestled my depressive demons, which was so hard oh my god I have no idea how I got the mental energy to keep going, and started tracking again. Despite it all. Despite the hole I was in and despite starting a job again in November and all the stress and mental breakdowns and despite getting a herniated disc in August 25 which made me literally unable to exercise up until now (yes, almost 4 months of physical therapy).

I weighed myself yesterday. 79.1kg. Lowest I've been in perhaps 10 years, and I checked – it's fat loss, not muscle loss. Cause I actually worked on my muscles to support my back, albeit very gently. And today, my physical therapist told me my back is ready for exercise again and we can start doing a fitness routine starting next week to build my muscle back up. And I'm also slowly finding the confidence in my abilities again professionally.

I just had SUCH a bad year. It sucked so much, my god. And to stand here at the end of it, 7kg lighter despite it all, and knowing I have persevered and kept going again and again for an ENTIRE YEAR is insane to me. I'm so proud of myself. I really am. And I have always struggled with loving myself and giving myself credit, but I am so, so proud of myself for not ending my life, for continuing to fight and work on myself on so many areas in my life – the weight is just the most tangible one since it's literal numbers on a scale. I could have easily given up and let myself go. I did for 3 months. And then I actively told myself to get up and keep going.

Sorry for the long post. I know the weightloss seems like very little, but knowing what was behind it makes it very meaningful for me. 🥲 I'm glad I can at least end the year being proud of myself despite the lack of perspective.",,,,2025-12-08 12:01:07.47576+00,7,0,null,en,1,2025-12-08 11:10:08,21806,4,,,"[""dietary_modification"",""quality_of_life""]","[""weakness""]",[],[],[],"[""calorie counting and exercise"",""mental energy to keep going"",""herniated disc"",""physical therapy"",""lowest I've been in 10 years"",""support my back"",""fitness routine"",""weight loss journey"",""persevered despite depression"",""proud of myself""]",not_relevant,0.8,General weight management and mental health discussion without bariatric or PBH context,patient,0.9,"[""Diet"",""Quality of Life"",""Symptoms""]",positive,,"[""pride"",""determination"",""relief""]","[""sharing_experience"",""celebrating_success""]",[],"[""topics_dietary_modification_035"",""topics_quality_of_life_048"",""symptoms_weakness_023"",""audience_anchor_patient_anchor_001""]",,1765192208,none,9,low

 Anyway I have been eating festively and having a few drinks (im usually a non drinker) but catching up with friends and fam means lots of festive cheer. 

Got on the scales yesterday morning 5 pounds up, now i usually fluctuate a few pounds maybe 2 or 3 but 5 ! . thats happened in just 3 weeks. 

So plan is instead of berating myself and saying stuff it eat what you want over xmas and get back on new year (this is what the old kelly would have said) I have written down whats been happening and im fully concentrating on moving and eating just whole foods until xmas, then i will have a few days chill and then just hop back in.

The short story is this summer I went to my PCP and stepped on the scale at 404lbs.  Decided to fix this problem.

  
The long story:  In 2015 I was in the best shape of my life.  I was spending around 20 hours a week being physically active.  I had a trainer, I had a sport, I had a gym etc.  Then my world turned upside down.  My now exwife had an affair and blamed it on me not being around due to working out and also I was so picky about food.  We divorced, I tried to maintain the same routines but I had also changed jobs at this time and it just wasn't working out with everything going on.  In hindsight, I went into deep depression and blamed my good habits for my position in life.  To this day, I have not been to the gym and cringe at the idea of meal planning.  I am working on that.   I went from 190 lbs of pure muscle to 404 lbs in 10 years.  It didn't help to have Covid in the middle there because that's when I almost got a gf that was starting to make life fun again.  She worked in the medical field so we stopped dating in April 2020.   About 3 years ago I had to move towns and started working 3 jobs and messed up my sleep.  I started having insomnia issues and was passing out in the middle of a sentence on the phone type deal.  In early 2025 I was watching youtube and one of the people I followed had a stroke.  He was my age and super healthy.  It freaked me out.  I could NOT do that to my family.  Something had to be done.  It took me months to get into a dr due to the new town.  We decided that my bloodwork was actually kind of ok despite my weight and that we needed to figure out my sleep issues.  Sleep study says I have really really bad Apnea.  In September I finally got the CPAP at home and started using it and within 2 weeks I was a different person. I not longer lacked desire to do anything, I started walking the dog further and further, I no longer fell asleep at 10a, 1030a, 11a, 1215p etc.  I called my old trainer.  He told me for now, just walk, no gym, no plans, just get the body moving.  I paid for my fitness pal because logging my food no longer felt like it was causing my life issues (divorce trauma).  I got a smart watch that counts steps and miles etc.  I check in with my old trainer occasionally.  Not paying him yet, he's just a friend right now for accountability.  As of this week I am 382lbs.  I am down 22lbs since I started this journey.  I am excited to keep this up and reach my first goal weight of 220.   When I first started walking I was doing like a half mile and was toast.  Now I walk a mile no problem and I'm going to start adding some minor strength training.  For food I'm literally just doing calorie deficit at this point but I'm not being hypervigilant due to my relationship with food.  

Anyways, wanted to put it out there in the world.

Without having to pay a lot to a fitness trainer.,"As the title says, I’m a 28F who’s never been very fit. I’m looking for someone who might have some expertise with cutting/bulking or just experience yourself with getting fit. I currently weigh 155lbs. But I don’t have a lot of muscle from losing 84lbs. My lowest was 118 and I looked very skeletal from not having any muscle. I’ve gained some back from poor eating. So I’m assuming it’s mostly fat, I feel a bit more stronger.

I’m mostly doing home workouts and I usually only have enough time for 3-4 30-40min workouts a week (I have a young son and work full time).

My biggest is eating. Trying to follow macros but I’m doing a poor job. I have ADHD so I’m having a hard time starting the workouts and eating healthy because I feel like it won’t work! Please let me know if this sounds good!

My biggest dilemma is if I should just go to cutting or bulking a bit first!

If I plan to bulk a bit first (I feel I’ll have better success starting here due to not having to calorie restrict too much and start working out at the same time)

155lbs Calories 1900-2000 Macros Protein 100-120g Fat 90g Carbs 150-200g

Then to cut Calories 1400-1500 Protein 100-120g Fat 50-60g Carbs 100-150g

Also this is with it set at ‘light exercise’ (I work at a hospital 4x a week and am chasing my son around the other 3) does this quality as moderate exercise if I add my workouts in 3-4x a week?? Does it matter to change it in my macros??

When I went to my physician a couple years ago he pretty much shrugged his shoulders and said it’s something I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life.

32776,reddit.com,t3_1pgkw81,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pgkw81/cardiac_symptoms_meds_interaction/,Cardiac symptoms &amp; meds interaction?,"TLDR at the bottom of the post because I tend to be a little thorough in these.

18 AFAB with exercise-induced asthma (alledgedly), costochondritis flare-ups, and an ongoing but undiagnosed cardiac problem. Used to have an Albuterol rescue inhaler, but it never worked, so I was switched to Levalbuterol, which I have yet to see work as well. I've never had an asthma attack, but I do experience shortness of breath or slight difficulty breathing. Also been taking 10mg of Propranolol three times a day since late September after a hospital visit, but recently started taking 200mg of Qelbree.

There's two parts to this post, I guess. I saw a pediatric cardiologist back in June who did an echocardiogram, but he never believed my symptoms, so I never saw him again. I hounded his office for a monitor, which I wore three days, and a month later (early September), it took my PCP calling for him to call us and say I had a run of ventricular tachycardia and would need an antiarrhythmic for the rest of my life. Neither me or my father were interested in seeing him, so we waited until I was 18 to see my dad's cardiologist, which was this past Monday.

He was more receptive, but he was getting his information from my previous care team's notes, which is why I think he wasn't all that concerned. He's thinks I have Innapropriate Sinus Tachycardia, told me not to worry about the v-tach run, and bumped my Propranolol up to 60mg because I often forget some doses throughout the day. Essentially, everyone's back to thinking it's nothing.

I was hoping he would do a stress test because I can hardly walk up or down a set of stairs without needing to sit down, and the nurse asked me if I've did one before he came in, but he never mentioned doing one. He wants me to wear another monitor in January, but while on the Propranolol? I don't know if that's normal, but I would think he'd want raw results?

Nevertheless, the point of this part is for me to ask: do I ask for a stress test? This all began while I was in physical therapy, and my physical therapist helped me discover that while riding a stationary bike, my heart rate was a constant 190bpm (back in May/June, anyway), I would start to lose my vision a few minutes in, my chest and upper back would hurt, and I'd be short of breath. I feel like this prompts a stress test, especially as just walking or climbing stairs gets harder, but maybe not, which is why I'm asking. I'll leave a link with a screenshot of all my symptoms written out in a list with a lazy timeline lol.

The second half of this is about the Qelbree and Propranolol. I've seen possible interactions listed, but all to do with increased blood pressure or heart rate. I haven't started the 60mg of Propranolol, because the 10mg with the Qelbree seems to be causing me to be experiencing unusual symptoms or ones that usually disappear while I'm taking Propranolol. These include increased shortness of breath, chest and left arm pain, a cold sensation in the middle of my chest (like that vapor rub stuff -- that's how my dad told me to describe it when I call my doctor tomorrow 😪), I'm tired but that could be a side effect of the Qelbree, and my hands are feet are colder than usual, even with added heat. I also think it's lowering my blood pressure (which is usually either normal or borderline low, like 100/60), but I have no way to check from home. I plan to call my cardiologist Monday, but is this anything that requires immediate attention? On the first day of taking Qelbree, I missed my morning Propranolol dose, took it at 3pm like usual, fell asleep for one or two hours, and an hour after I woke up, my heart rate was 44bpm. It hasn't happened since then (that I'm aware of), but I felt like it needed to be mentioned.

TLDR; 1. Worrying symptoms with exercise (and some at rest). Do I ask for a stress test? 2. Weird symptoms when taking Qelbree and Propranolol together. Do I keep taking them until I call my cardiologist, or do I stop taking the two together? Do I need to be checked out before then?

Hi everyone,
I’m looking for a general medical perspective from doctors experienced with cervical spine injuries.

A few months ago, I had a serious freeride/downhill biking accident and fractured my C7 vertebral body into four pieces. I underwent surgery where the surgeons removed the damaged C7 vertebra, replaced it with an implant, and stabilized everything with a titanium plate. So far, the healing process is going normally according to my doctors.

Before the accident I was active in sports, but not heavy weightlifting. My main sport was freeride/downhill.

I fully understand you can’t give a personal medical clearance, but I’m hoping for general medical insights:

Is it realistically possible for someone with a C7 vertebral body replacement to return to high-impact sports like freeride/downhill?

What conditions need to be met before returning to this kind of sport?

How long does it usually take before someone with this type of injury could even consider riding again?

What are the main risks of returning to high-impact sports after a C7 implant and titanium plate?

The diagnosis of developmental differences has improved, and our current society is much more informed and better trained, so it’s easier for anyone to identify when a child shows signs of being neurodivergent.

Timeline / symptoms:

Day 1: I started with back pain, which has since eased a bit, then progressed into a very bad headache that has not gone away and is now on day 7. The headache is intense and constant and is not like my usual headaches.

Day 2: Symptoms stayed the same. I assumed it was just a bad headache.

Day 3: I visited a walk in clinic and was prescribed naproxen. I took it as directed with food about 8 to 10 hours apart.

Days 2 to 4: I had chills but never had a fever. On these nights I also woke up drenched in sweat. The chills have since stopped.

Day 4: I started developing stomach pain. It feels like it is in my lower stomach, but it is hard to tell because of how intense it is and often feels like my entire stomach.

Around the same time, my urine became cloudy.

Days 4 to 5: I stopped taking all medications because the stomach pain started.

Day 5: No new symptoms appeared, but the headache was still very severe, my urine was still cloudy, and the stomach pain was still present.

Day 6: I had a bloody nose, which is unusual for me.

Day 7 at around 5 am: I woke up and vomited. Since the stomach pain started I have not been able to eat properly, as even thinking about food makes me nauseous. I have mostly only been able to eat small amounts of plain crackers and some fruit.

ER visit:
I went to the ER 2 days ago, before the vomiting and nosebleed. I also did not mention that my urine was cloudy because it had started that morning and I assumed I might be dehydrated. They diagnosed me with a migraine and discharged me, telling me that rest and fluids would resolve it.

Medications I was taking:
Advil
Tylenol
Naproxen, which I took twice about 8 hours apart and then stopped because it did not help and I was worried it was causing stomach pain

I stopped all medications on days 4 to 5 and have not taken any since, except Tums once.

Now I’m worried because the headache has not resolved and new symptoms have continued to appear, including vomiting, cloudy urine, stomach pain, and prior back pain, which do not seem consistent with a migraine.

I am staying as hydrated as possible and resting, but I genuinely do not feel like I am improving.

Questions:
Does this sound like something more than a migraine?
Could this be related to kidney issues, infection, or medication side effects such as a UTI or kidney infection, sti?(sti unlikely but I don’t want to leave anything off the table)
Should I return to the ER or go to urgent care?

I'm inclined to think it's NOT my workout causing it bc I got it massaged on Wednesday, then missed my next workout due to a holiday party, and then I had the pain again. So the pain came back without a workout in between.

So this is something thats been persistent for a couple of weeks at this point where I (M17) have this weird feeling in the area under my calf where its a bit numb and feels kinda tight. The reason I'm worried it might be nerve damage is because I cut my thigh and I had this weird shooting sensation throughout my leg and im not sure if the areas would be connected at all (it was around the middle of my thigh iirc). For the record I do not and have not cut in the area that has the numbness which is the weird part. The numbness also kinda reminds me of how the area around the incision that was made for the surgery on my collarbone feels but the area under my calf feels a bit more numb and has the tightness as well. 

Its not really painful or anything and I can still walk normally so I dont really feel like bringing it up with a doctor since that would get back to my parents and I dont want that but I am still worried that I caused some level of damage (other than the regular damage that comes with cutting ofc)",,,,2025-12-07 21:00:50.044078+00,2,0,null,en,1,2025-12-07 16:22:14,21767,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1765124534,,,

It looked (looking down) like a browny patch hence me thinking malteser mess.

Rubbed it slightly and it felt almost waxy, it then look white (see first photo), I'm still not computing properly so I scratch it and the white, waxy feeling tissue comes off. I feel fine other than the patch is sore from touching it.

It must've appeared in the last 24hrs or so as I had a shower yesterday morning, I use a shower chair and stare at my legs mostly!

My legs have never got much in the way sun, and none in months. I have no memory of injuring that area and can't fathom it as it doesn't have the normal 'look' or 'feel' of an injury in terms of scabbing etc. the waxy feeling is wigging me out.

I’m looking for some perspective from people who’ve experienced something similar or have medical insight.

About 25 days ago I started having a dull, aching sensation in my testicles. It lasted about a week, then shifted more toward a come-and-go type of ache. It’s never been severe. It was constantly there for the first week but since then has never been constant. Since then, the sensations have kind of moved around and changed rather than getting worse.

My symptoms over the past few weeks:
• On/off dull testicular ache that comes and goes for hours and sometimes up to a day (sometimes fully gone)
• Sensations shift between testicles, perineum, butt area, and sometimes the penis (weird sensation in the penis I don’t know how to describe properly, kind of like an ache/tingling/weird pushing feeling)
• Occasionally a mild pulsing or awareness feeling in the penis (not painful)
• Symptoms often feel worse at night or when sitting still
• Feel better with walking, movement, and distractions
• No visible swelling, redness, or heat
• No burning when peeing
• No persistent discharge
• Urine looks normal

I was sick about 1.5 weeks ago with fever, cough, runny nose, chills, and headache, but I believe it was unrelated as many people in my circle were also sick. The fever, chills, and headache lasted about 2 days, and the other symptoms dragged on for around 3 days after that. All of that has since fully resolved.

I’ve checked visually many times and everything looks normal. Pain does not worsen when touching or examining the testicles.

I’ve been under a lot of stress recently (school/finals and anxiety spiraling), and I’ve noticed that the more I focus on the symptoms, the more I notice them.

I’ve read about pelvic floor tension/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, anxiety-related nerve sensitization, and epididymitis, but my symptoms don’t seem to match the classic presentation for infection (though I could be wrong, so please let me know).

I’m aware that Googling makes things worse, which is why I wanted to put everything in one place and ask for calmer feedback.

My main questions are:
• Does this pattern sound more like pelvic floor tension or anxiety-related symptoms rather than an infection? If it sounds like an infection, would it be more along the lines of a UTI or STI, and is it even worth getting tested?
• Has anyone had testicular or pelvic discomfort that migrated like this and resolved with time?
• Is it common for these symptoms to fluctuate for several weeks without being something serious?

On Friday morning while I drove to work I noticed a choking chemical taste in the back of my mouth / throat. I presumed it was the fumes from the car in front of me so I turned off my blowers but when I got to work and had a drink and my breakfast the taste continued. It lasted the whole day and some of my food for the day didn’t taste right (not usual and also unpleasant) and hot food made my tongue feel itchy and burning.

I slept and woke up the yesterday and it was gone, but it popped up again during the day, went again, and returned during my evening meal. During this day the only food that tasted incorrect was my hot evening meal. The taste went away a while after eating but then popped back up around 6 hours after eating. I brushed my teeth and chewed gum but this just exacerbated the taste.

Today I woke up without the taste but I went out for lunch, and around 10 minutes  after eating the flavour returned intensely and hasn’t gone away.

It’s a very intense taste, like paracetamol and hair spray. It’s really unpleasant and makes me feel nauseous.

I had what I suspect was covid a month ago, and during being ill my taste of sense was funny, but it returned not long after being sick and everything has been normal for about 3 weeks, so this feels unrelated but the most immediately obvious cause.

I have done some googling and it says a chemical taste in mouth can also be caused by certain nutrient deficiencies - I did swap to a vegetarian diet in August but this feels way too randomly out of the blue to be this, but I am not ruling it out.

The taste also started a day after my period, not sure if that could be helpful info. I have also been suffering from an unknown medical condition that I haven’t been able to get checked out yet since July. I get very painful belches after eating and also randomly through the day with a feeling of something being stuck in my chest / throat (I suspect this is GORD/GERD). Again this could be linked but this feels very random and out of the blue for something I’ve been suffering with for a few months.

Any advice on what the cause might be would be greatly appreciated as I will likely struggle to get a drs appointment and will likely just be dismissed when I go and given a 6mo+ wait referral.

So 2 weeks ago, he had surgery to remove the old mesh and rebuild his abdominal wall. The day after the surgery, he spiked a fever. The hospital did a CT scan and found he had a nasty infection, so they had to reopen part of his incision to try to treat the infection.

The bag has a little drain at the bottom so since he’s been home (he’s only been home 2 days at this point), a few times a day he drains the infection build up into the toilet.

The bad news is that it has resulted in bulging discs in my back, one of which compress the main vein that go to my legs, which caused blood clots in both legs.

I’m seeing multiple doctors - a thrombologist, oncologist, and a physiatrist. I take a lot of meds (morphine, blood thinners, etc). I have tried using compression socks. I have undergone one operation(an angioplasty, but not in the heart), in which they tried to stent the vein, but when they tried to push out the blockage, the tool actually bent, so it was, ultimately, unsuccessful. My insurance won’t cover physical therapy and I am on disability.

Hi, I did finally go to the hospital the other night and I was treated so horrible. They sent me to the psych side of the hospital and I wasn't treated as a psych inpatient (got to keep my stuff, didn't have a 1:1, worse my own clothes) but they treated me as mental health only.

It lists my reason for visit as: ""pt upset from argument few days ago"" and diagnoses as ""Alleged assault""

I kept asking to speak to a social worker as soon as I got there and I never did. They then woke me up at 5am and said I was being discharged. I saw they unplugged my laptop so I couldn't email my dad to ask for him to get me an uber so I asked for a few minutes to plug it in and they refused telling me if I didn't leave that room immediately they would get security. I started crying and asked if they could get me a bus pass but it would requires over 30+ minutes of walking and I still can't walk very well much less that far, so security grabbed my stuff and brought it down the lobby.

I asked if I can just sit there and charge it and they told me no and they would call the cops if they saw I was still sitting there. One of the desk ladies immediately let me use the phone once they left and I came home and just cried and cried and cried.

They said it was ""absolutely a concussion"" but didn't put it on the diagnosis chart. I kept asking to have a female nurse or if they had anyone from victim services to be with me and this is part of a domestic violence case and really needed someone to talk to. They brushed it off.

I was treated like I was overreacting and was asked ""if it was that bad, why didn't you go to the hospital then?"" and I was trying to explain to him everything that happened but he was literally rolling his eyes while I was starting to cry about how scared I was.

So now I feel like I'm just defeated. I didn't even get to tell the story of what happened/the details of the abuse/how, where, what he hit me with. I didn't get to show the police reports, more pictures of the injuries and where. I feel so mocked.

We took him to a podiatrist 2 weeks ago. He pressed on it and said because it turns white it means it's not infected. It's just inflamed. He also said it doesn't look ingrown. He gave us some antibiotic cream to use and said to soak it in epsom salt baths.

We'll likely go see another doctor either way, but I'd appreciate any opinions from anyone here as to what could be going on to cause it to still be red all these weeks. My son says it doesn't hurt him.

I’m 18 F but a vulnerable adult and my parents are my carers. I have Autism,PTSD and Depression. I’ve been suicidal since I was 10. But the last few days have been the worst I’ve ever been in my life.

I’ve had legal issues and had a breakdown because of it. I couldn’t talk. Was very confused. Still finding it hard to have a full conversation now. I can’t process things people are saying to me easily. But at the time I could barely talk. And had short term memory loss. 

I really wanted to die. I called 111 option 2 (UK) with my mum. They were very concerned because of the state I was in. They said they’ll contact my mother about the crisis team seeing me and a medical doctor to get my heart checked out just incase it was a heart attack. It’s been a few days and I thought they just completely ignored me. I was still really confused and suicidal. 

Today I got a letter saying because of my level of response they’ve closed me off. My mother said it’s because she got given a number for me to ring because the phone number they was calling on wasn’t working. So she just ignored it because she said they wouldn’t be able to do anything anyway Im fine.

Hi everyone. I’m a 40 year-old female, and for the past 2 years I’ve been dealing with a persistent, unexplained skin issue that no doctor has been able to fully diagnose.

I get recurring bumps, clogged pores, and lesions that don’t behave like normal acne. They often heal very slowly and sometimes leave behind pitted marks. More recently, I developed an indentation/linear groove on my face that looks like a 2” scarred line but it keeps extending in length over time. It has resulted from the plugs which look like white heads, but are not. 

I’ve tried various topical treatments over these two years, but nothing has resolved the underlying issue. I’m becoming increasingly distressed because of the progressive indenting and scarring pattern on my face. 

I’m wondering what conditions could cause something like this (for example: follicular disorders, eruptive vellus hair cysts, atrophoderma, connective-tissue issues, etc.) and whether I should push for a biopsy or specific type of specialist.i

Any guidance on what this could be, what tests I should ask for, and whether this kind of linear scarring is typical of any known skin condition would be greatly appreciated.

I've been feeling some discomfort to my left testicle in the past week and a bit and while it's not unbearable and most of the time I don't even feel it, but it's sometimes uncomfortable and tender to the touch (not in the same way that those bits are just sensitive) and doesn't seem to be going away and maybe even getting worse? That last part is hard to tell 'cause it's really still very mild.  
  
  
If an ankle sprain or whatever had this level of discomfort I'd hardly care and would just wait it out but considering the affected body part I'm starting to get worried.

I’ll take any advice,"22m- This all started 5 years ago when I suddenly had a massive amount of constant discomfort on a spot on the left side of the back my neck that immediately became a massive burden. I wouldn’t describe it as pain, just a constant feeling that something is off that I felt no matter what. One side of my neck feels strong and normal while the other feels like the exact opposite. The best way I’ve learned to describe it is that my neck feels like it’s locked up and needs to be cracked at all times, no matter what. It’s still always been very hard to describe to people. I hope you guys understand what I’m trying to describe though. 

It was the worst when it first started, and the only way I could get any comfort was doing this weird jolting movement with my head to left. I have no idea why this worked but I did it so much out of necessity that people thought I had a tick, and I honestly wasn’t sure if I did. This went on for a long time, and in the bad moments I’d have to the movement constantly for hours just to get through the day. 

I don’t know how or when but eventually the discomfort started spreading out more on the left side of my neck and instead of that little movement I was able to feel momentary comfort from fully cracking my neck. There are a million ways that i’ve figured out how to crack my neck for relief , most of them I’m pulling or stretching insanely hard. It’s probably not safe, but when it gets at its worst I literally can’t function at all and I think about is the feeling in my neck. I estimate that I crack my neck at least once every 10 minutes. The severity of the discomfort really comes and goes, but when it’s really bad I’m basically constantly cracking it all day. I’m curious if it’s normal to be able to crack my neck this much, it literally always makes noise and cracks. 

I’ve been told that it could be an issue with posture or looking down at my phone but I’m really not that concerned about the cause of the issue at the point. I just want to know if there’s any way one day I can wake up without feeling this awful sensation. 

Is there a specific kind of doctor I could see about this who could help me? Is it possible that I’m dealing with something more than just effects of bad posture? Idk if this helps at all but my fantasy has always been that one of those shots that the athletes take for relief could help me. Is that something I could look into? Any other recommendations? 

I’m getting desperate, I’ll take anything even if the answer is just go to physical therapy. I would like to say though that i’ve tried every stretch and chiropractor (unfortunately) possible.

27F, 4 months postpartum. Breastfeeding for two years. History of postpartum thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression, ptsd. 

I recently posted regarding my lymph node ultrasound due to multiple nodes in my left infraclavicular area. I had two ultrasounds on the area and the ultrasound could not pick up the lymph nodes even though I know they are there. I can feel them. They are soft, movable and less than 1cm. One of them is a little more firm. One ultrasound couldn’t pick up anything and the other found possibly two lipomas even though there is five lumps that feel like nodes. One ultrasound tech told me that if it were anything pathological she would find it and it was likely just lymph nodes or lipomas. However I am not happy because I am worried it could be something serious like breast cancer. I have no lumps, or changes in my breast. Sometimes I get shooting pain that’s mild. But I also had mastitis four times from September to October (twice in each breast). I also recently had a chest x ray that was clear, an upper abdominal ultrasound that was clear as well. I also had a breast ultrasound two years ago that was clear. 

Should I push for a breast ultrasound? Everywhere I read says infraclavicular nodes can be a sign of breast cancer. 

Edit: I also notice new lymph nodes popping up but I’m unsure if it is because I’m constantly poking the area for the last two-three weeks.

Things that may have brought this on or worsened it:

My whole left side, shoulder to foot, felt sore for a few days and at times numb or weak in extremities. We travelled across the country (6hr plane ride this past Monday going home) a few days later. 

The initial discomfort started after returning home. When it started on Thursday I figured it was a tweak that would sort itself out and because it was mild I didn't think sex would be a bad idea. Now I'm concerned that having sex exacerbated what might have otherwise been a passing condition. But I haven't had sex since as it's been worsening. If it matters, sex that time wasn't like.... vigorous.

Lastly, if I had to describe the pain: sore internally, itchy/raw feeling on skin (again there's no visible irritation)

My goal right now is to determine how serious this is and whether or not I should go to urgent care or wait and schedule with my GP on Tuesday.",,,,2025-12-07 21:00:50.044078+00,1,0,null,en,2,2025-12-07 18:33:43,21730,7,,,"[""care_settings""]","[""pelvic_discomfort"",""lower_abdomen_discomfort"",""groin_pain"",""left_lower_back_soreness"",""radiating_leg_pain"",""skin_sensitivity""]",[],"[""PCOS""]",[],"[""pelvic discomfort"",""groin pain"",""radiating leg pain"",""skin sensitivity"",""Kyleena IUD""]",not_relevant,0.9,Symptom inquiry unrelated to bariatric surgery or PBH-specific context,patient,0.9,"[""Symptoms"",""Care Settings""]",concerned,,"[""concern"",""anxiety""]","[""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_care_settings_051"",""symptoms_pelvic_discomfort_XXX"",""symptoms_lower_abdomen_discomfort_XXX"",""symptoms_groin_pain_XXX"",""symptoms_left_lower_back_soreness_XXX"",""symptoms_radiating_leg_pain_XXX"",""symptoms_skin_sensitivity_XXX"",""conditions_PCOS_XXX""]",,1765132423,,,

Like most people my age I was out partying all the time, but it escalated fast. By 18 I’d slipped into drinking every day, and that pretty much became my normal. I’m 26 now, just to give context to the sorts of strains I’ve put my body under (please don’t shame me, I know and I’m working on it - I’ve pretty much completely cut alcohol out now. 

About five months ago I started getting this odd sensation on my left side. just under my rib cage, wrapping slightly into my back and mid-side. It began as a strange twang I couldn’t explain. When I went sober for 12 days recently it didn’t go, or really did back it got worse - I drank a few beers one night after as I let cravings get the better of me and the ache just got worse with  vengeance. I’ve cut down almost completely since then, and even when I do drink it’s literally one beer. No joke.

The sensation has now become a dull, deep ache. Throughout the day it settles and flares up. It’s mainly on my upper left side, but lately my right side sometimes has those early same twinges too. It doesn’t change with movement or pressure, and the feeling is deep inside, not muscular. It’s extremely uncomfortable and I’ve

it started as heartburn and i went to the gp and was put on PPi;s to help with that. it helped with the heartburn and it was suspected i had a hiatal hernia which made sense given my history of heavy lifting, BJJ and being 120kg/265lb bodyweight at 6'2 so not the smallest guy.

i was put on terbinfine at the same time for a fungal infection and after about 4 weeks i felt quite noticeably worse with feeling nauseous after any BJJ sparring unless i took a cyclizine to block it out.

around the time of this i noticed any time id eat my pre training meal that i had eaten for years of 2 tins of tuna on baked potato's i felt unusually bloated and queasy after eating it, id eat this a solid 5 hours before training every day so i changed to scambled eggs on toast and felt better on that. this was back in july 25'

i would even notice after taking some sips of my water when first waking up in would feel like it just sat in my stomach and bloated from just drinking water, meals would take 6-8+ hours to fully digest and for the bloating to dissipate. the bloating is noticably worse after eating meals with fat in them, for example toast and wheatabix will go down noticably easier than anything fatty which will take ages to digest and i have to keep my per meal volume low. i'd also get this gnawing sensation epigastically which has improved a bit since my diet adjustments but unless i eat the most bland foods or do a long walk after eating the bloating is still very persistent and the queasy/nauseous feeling has worsened and become more chornic over time. i get a lot of belching, indigestion, would have terrible heart burn if not for the ppis and feel full after eating nowhere near what i used to eat (i used to eat a lot of large meals with very high protein for years to build muscle etc. ive always had a very large appetite) 

i went back to the dr to explain this and we did a full bloods panel and renal tests which all came back normal. the bloating/abdominal cramps worsened and my gp suspected i might have been reacting badly to the PPI's so moved me to famotidine, not as strong but seemed to suit better for the time being.

after researching with no symptom alleviation i had to stop training bjj and can only do the gym with keeping the intensity lower, i went back to the dr and he suspected potentially a h pylori infection so ordered a FIT test to check for blood in my stool as well as a h pylori test and a calprotectin test. the h pylori came back negative.

the fit test came back positive of 23 and meant i was told to have a colonoscopy to check for crohns/ UC  and obviously just to check for colon cancer, the colonoscopy was completely normal. the surgeon suspected a hiatal hernia to be the cause too, at this time my calprotectin hadnt come back and once that came back a week or so after it was 600+ very high and although not the most accurate, a clear sign inflammation was high in my upper gi.

my gp contacted a gastroenterologist asking for the next best route given the high calprotected and clear colonoscopy and they responded by saying an endoscopy would be a sensible idea and the high calprotectin is rarely found in isolated upper GI pathology and the recent positive result is likely to be secondary to an infective gastroenteritis or even NSAID usage (i wasnt taking any nsaids at all)

at the time leading up to this test result i was under the impression i might have had SIBO, a lot of symptoms seemed to match so i decided to go onto a carnivore diet as i had read that carnivore was good for symptom relief, everything was worse on this. my bloating was terrible i needed to walk for 30 mins after every meal just to not feel extremely bloated and nauseous. my stools were pale and greasy, i was clearly not digesting fats from the diet at all, i lost a considerble amount of weight over the week i did the diet and felt like death, the fatigue was unbearable. as soon as i stopped and went back to carbs i felt an improvement and my weight went back up.

i definitely think another repeat calprotectin would show a much lower count given my upper gi symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were on the carnivore diet at the time that i took this test

i explained this to the gp but every time they just dont seem to care for the pale stools.

symtoms haven't improved at all and of the last week or so ive had this dull ache in my mid left/central back, my posture is bad but i havnt had this sensation before, and after increasing my fiber intake in my diet considerably my stools havnt been too bad but the pale colour is still there.

i eat a healthy, what i would call normal diet with just recently increasing my fiber dramatically to help my gut.

i even had 6 eggs the other night on toast and the next morning i noticed a considerably more greasy stool and a lot looser than normal just from that meal alone.

around that time my heartburn was terrible, even on 40mg famotidine per day it was bad so i had to move back to the omperazole and im taking 40mg currently to prevent the heartburn.

im spending a large portion of my day feeling a low level of nausea/queasiness that comes and goes in waves but is waking me up in the night at times and its really quite unpleasant. i mentioned the pale stool and almost coffee granule looking stool when i wipe to the gp 2 days ago and again she glossed over it without a care because i have the endoscopy in 10 days time, but im not sure if that will even show anything given the problem is so likely to be more bile duct/pancreas etc (at least thats where my head is at given my research on my symptoms)

i went back to the urgent dr when my heartburn was terrible because i couldn't sleep and she recommended i move back across, and i had another full bloods panel and renal done again 2 days ago so just waiting for the results to come back from that in the next couple of days where im assuming its not going to show the fat malabsorption

im still awaiting the endoscopy in 10 days time but im just concerned they arent looking in the right place and my anxiety is getting really bad around it all because im good at catastrophising and immediately worry its pancreatic cancer because thats how my brain works so I'm just looking for anyone anecdotally or much better educated than myself to offer some advice. i feel like im going through all the steps im being told to but the focus was first on my colon, then my stomach/small intestines but i feel like theyre looking in the wrong place and its affecting my mental health dramatically.

its got to the point that I've just been tempted to buy my own CT scan privately  to get answers but don't know whether its worth doing.

Early this morning, I woke up with a sharp, warm, throbbing pain in my right knee. The pain isn’t constant, but certain positions make it much worse. Sometimes it feels like a deep ache or a “nunuot” type of pain, and it occasionally radiates upward toward my hip.

There is no visible swelling, and the joint isn’t hot to the touch, but the pain itself feels warm and uncomfortable. The strange part is: the pain becomes more manageable when I elevate my leg. Standing still or lying flat makes it more painful.

I was poking around on MyChart because I was curious about results for a blood draw. I saw my notes for a visit before my previous visit were available so I went to read them out of curiosity. All my current medical issues were as they appeared normally, but I noticed that autism was now listed under ""Past Medical History"". It literally states,  ""Autism (HCC-HHS) - Treated for mild autism early years x 2-3 years. Now considered recovered."" This change was made during an appointment in May and I only found out because I was snooping. I was never directly informed at any point. 

I am confused and kinda pissed because 1. That's not how it works. You can't ever ""recover"" from autism, because it's a lifelong condition. You just get better at adapting and managing it with age, becoming ""high functioning"". And 2. Why didn't she consult me prior to making this change, and if she felt it was necessary, do proper testing to see if I still qualify for diagnosis? 

I was diagnosed when I was 2, and have received services via an IEP/ISFP essentially my entire life because of it. I was in 40 hours of speech/OT/ABA until I was 6, and I receive accommodations in college because of it. I am scared those will be taken away somehow, even though I am in my last semester. I also plan to get a service dog in a few years, but obviously I can't do that without a diagnosis. I don't have the money to afford an adult diagnosis, nor do I think it would make any sense to pursue one given that I already have extensive records of my autism. 

Will this change in medical history have any impact on me receiving services? Will it change anything with my insurance? Can I ask her to put the diagnosis back as it was? What do I do?

32713,reddit.com,t3_1pgqqfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pgqqfd/bad_nose_breath/,Bad nose breath,"Looking for advice or any information on what could be causing bad nose breath. My (20f) boyfriend (22m) says my nose breath is really bad. 

Here’s what we know: the smell doesn’t come from my mouth (it’s not tonsil stones, I’ve checked them, flushed them, switched to alcohol free mouthwashes, salt water gargles, tongue scrapers, water pick, etc.) and he says no matter how much I brush, mouthwash, or chew gum the smell is only coming from my nose and it can’t be helped. We’ve recently tried a saline spray-mist and at first he said it made it less but only slightly and he still smells it. He says it is not a constant smell, that it typically comes once a month and stays for about a week or several days then goes away again (going on for about a year now). Recently it has been on and off for two weeks now. 

I’ve asked close friends and family and all say that they have never smelled it. One evening when my boyfriend smelled it he asked if I could ask my parents and they noted that it did smell a bit garlicky, but not bad. We are not sure if this is because I had butter chicken for lunch that day, or if this is what he is smelling but can’t place it. He can’t describe it, says it’s smells like “bad breath” and has described it as “sweet and sour” he has a sensitive nose and the smell is very strong to him and it makes us both incredibly uncomfortable when we are close to each other (I am extremely self conscious now and he feels uncomfortable telling me I smell) and it’s causing a lot of problems for us. 

I’m at a loss of what it could be, and he wants me to go to a doctor, but the situation is complicated. I’m a college student with really crap insurance that expires in 3 weeks and I’ll need to find an in-network primary physician, get an appt, then get a referral for an ENT and get that appt all in the next 3 weeks (and both appts will cost me at least $150 in copay alone). I’m desperate for an answer, the anxiety and paranoia that I smell is ruining my life and all of my relationships, I am even uncomfortable sitting next to people in class or sharing a car with others and I feel overwhelming anxiety that everyone thinks I smell and is lying to me. It makes me not want to speak, open my mouth, or even breathe when I’m around others. I’ve been obsessively brushing, gone through half a bottle of mouthwash in one week, and done hours of research but it all feels pointless. 

When I am home for winter break I will be using a dehumidifier consistently, and trying a complete saline rinse (guru nanda bottle that is like a neti pot). My mom suggested peppermint oil pills if it is GI related, but I don’t feel any symptoms of acid reflux or GI problems. 

Other details that may or may not be relevant: I had a septum and nose piercing in my teenage years which have since been closed, I’ve cleaned them with saline and moisturized with coconut oil + q-tip but unsure if it helped or did anything as I cannot smell what bf is smelling and have no way to tell when it is happening unless he’s around. Also, I had frequent sinus infections throughout my life especially in the winter time, but none this season so far. In fact I have only been sick once this semester, which I mostly attribute to better eating habits now that I’m off campus. I do get drippy nose when I’m out in the cold, but I can’t tell if I have post-nasal drip as I don’t feel it. Also I have almost no boogers, when I blow my nose after coming In from outside in the cold it’s pretty much always completely clear and odorless, and my nostrils actually feel extremely clear (too clear that it can hurt to breath in cold air).

For the past three-ish months, I've been feeling an uncomfortable pressure around my right ovary (from my perspective, so left if someone else is looking at me). It'll be directly where I think my ovary is based off of diagrams I've seen online.

The pressure goes away for a bit if I push down on the area, and usually comes back a few minutes later but sometimes stays before becoming more uncomfortable after a bit. The feeling comes up semi-frequently throughout the entire day.

I went to a doctor because I expected it to be a UTI, but she said it wasn't, and told me that it's something that happens during ovulation. The only issue with this is that it's been consistently happening throughout my entire cycle for the past three months.

Pregnancy is not the cause, as I have had my period twice (but a week late both times) throughout this time period (although I am sexually active). I also haven't experienced any difficulties with urination or defecation, aside from occasionally getting constipated.

Medications:

* Lamictal 200mg since May, was titrated onto it from 25mg=&gt;50=&gt;100=&gt;150 to now
* Doxycycline 100mg twice a day, started 2 months ago and ended after one month
* Bactrim 800/160mg twice a day, started one month ago after ending Doxycycline and still continuing now
* Lamictal for bipolar disorder, doxy and bactrim both for acne. I'm anemic but currently not taking anything for it. I'm anorexic but average weight if that's at all relevant
* I also take kirkland women's multivitamins and women's 3 in 1 probiotics

Is this something I should be concerned about, and is there a way to get rid of it?

I am a 26 year old male, 168 cm, 52 kg (shrunk from 59 kg in 3 years due to limited diet). I am asking for the goodwill of anyone with the expertise to help me with some much needed advice, because I feel hopeless with my current medical situation. If anyone can, please give me some advice because I can't do this anymore :( 

In 2022, after a period of some irregular eating and increased stress, as well as an episode where I accidentally swallowed a bigger dose of seawater (I don't know if any of these contribute to my current issues) I started to feel abdominal pain, around my belly button. I cut out acidic food, alcohol etc. from my diet, and for a while, it was better, but infrequent abdominal pain persisted. I cut out gluten and dairy as well, and again, for a while, it was better, but pain continued. Since May 2024, I would describe the pain as debilitating, to the point where I had to switch to a permanently remote job, resign from most of my friendships and center my whole life around pain management. I feel completely hopeless, because as I will list below, the best doctors in my country have run a whole bunch of diagnostics and have come up with no answers. I am currently considering traveling abroad for medically assisted suicide due to the pain having ruined much of my life. I think back with grief of my good life before this, when I had a strong health, positive relationships with friends and an open attitude towards the world, which is all gone now. 

The pain is a gnawing, dull feeling, very rarely cramping. I have no reflux, at all. From some foods, I have diarrhea, but from my safe foods (rice waffles, buckwheat, rice and millet porridge, boiled chicken breast, eggs) I don't. Rather I have a small constipation, but I have stool almost every day.

Diagnostics so far:

\- Parasitology: Earlier, around August 2024 (after symptoms became severe) blastocystis hominis was discovered. Tried to eradicate with metronidazole, then tinidazole, then paromomycin, as this was the only tangible finding. Since then, I have two negative stool tests, but doctors say that this is likely a red herring.

\- Gastroscopy: Antrum gastritis, Duodenitis chronica (no NSAID use, no h pylori, biopsy for coeliac is negative)

\- Colonoscopy: Everything normal, biopsy for microscopic colitis is negative  
\- Capsule endoscopy: Erosiones bulbi duodeni, red spots in the small intestine, Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in the ileum, negative visual for Crohn's disease

\- HIDA-scan: Negative, but felt horrible after for weeks from the dark chocolate that I had to eat to provoke my bile release  
\- Lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance tests negative, I anyhow don't eat these

\- Misc: Fecal calptotectin is negative, fecal pancreatic elastase negative, CT enterography negative 

  
Please, if anyone has any answers or help for me, don't hesitate to write your opinions. I am hopeless and terribly, terribly sad from more than 3 years of sickness.

For the past few weeks or so, all I've wanted to eat is eggs and rice cakes. Sometimes eggs and tortillas. Sometimes eggs and bread. Sometimes with cheese or avocado. But it's all I want. I eat 4 eggs for breakfast everyday. I've started letting myself eat 4 eggs for dinner too. So now I'm at 8 a day, everyday. I'm still holding back because even though I let myself have them for breakfast and dinner I want them for lunch too.

I buy them in packs of 30, and that used to last me a week but now I'm going back to the store multiple times a week to buy more eggs. I have to boil them every day to have them ready, and when I don't I'm extremely nervous. I mean come on, this is literally addict behavior?

This can't be normal right? This can't be healthy. I mean I know it's better than having pizza every meal (which I've done before in my life) but is it even that much better? A dozen eggs a day can't be okay right? At what point is it not it just unhealthy? Also why can't I stop? I feel like I'd get it if I was like craving some junk maybe but I don't want junk. I just want eggs. I usually LOVE sweets and desserts but I ate a processed cookie today and all I could think was that eggs would've been more satisfying. Mind you I of course have already eaten eggs today.


How bad is this? Will this diet be harmful to my overall health? What's causing this? How long can I go eating 8-12 eggs a day without it being bad for me, or how bad is it, or how can I stop myself?

I'm having hand surgery next Tuesday.  I had pre-op blood work, X-rays and EKG.  I logged into my account this morning and found the following notes:

X-ray - Lung Hyperinflation 

ECG - Right axis deviation 

Blood - Slightly high CO2 (30 mmol/L)

Blood - High Immature Granulocytes (.2%).

AI tells me it indicates a medical emergency and to go to the ER.  But I know it's tends to do that with a lot of things.   


*Note* I'm having hand surgery because I've been having tingling and numbness in both hands along with tight knuckles every night for almost a year.  I recently started having internal vibrations and tremors but not physically shaking.  

The doctor confirmed Carpel Tunnel, but doesn't think it's the main cause of these issues, but wanted to repair it anyhow to maybe get some relief.   

I'm not a smoker, (I've had a cigarette from time to time when drinking and such, but this was maybe a couple of times a year.   I was exposed to burn pits when deployed, and I hit my dad's vape occasionally.

Does not smoke

For background she lives in Chihuahua, Mexico, she has little to no income, and lives in a pretty dire state. She has recently started to lose more of her balance as she needs to hold on to someone to stand, and she has a hearing aid and she is expected to lose her hearing as I'm told, as well as looking worse every time I visit. She looks at least 20 years older than she is and she's only 2 years older than my mother who is 52.

I am not too aware about here complete range of symptoms, but it is apparently and issue that she has developed over the years. She was also abused in her teens by her mother and apparently my grandmother threw her to the ground messing her up further as she was always said to be ""odd"" in her time, as there was little to no understanding of the complexity of her symptoms.

She has recently told me and my mother in my last visit to Mexico that she wishes to pass as her pain is constant and she no longer wants to feel that way.

My auntie had a hard life and I wish to help her. I have a company here in United States, and although I am by no means some kind of millionaire, I do in fact have disposable income to spare to help my auntie.

So onto my question, where would a good start be to help her?

Looking for a bit of advice or shared experiences. My child (4F almost 5, 16.5kg) was totally healthy as a baby until just before her first birthday, when she got a vomiting/diarrhoea bug and ended up in hospital with dehydration. Since then things have been… complicated.

She’s had viral hepatitis twice (they think adenovirus), but her liver is fine now. Around that time they also found gallstones, but every test to look for an underlying cause came back negative.

Ever since all of this she’s had frequent fevers with no clear cause - usually 18–20 a year. She also gets a lot of stomach pain and sometimes has pale stools. Her faecal calprotectin has been raised a couple of times (highest was 302). GI said it’s “functional abdominal pain.” She had an MRI recently just to rule out anything major and thankfully that came back clear.

She’s seen an immunologist who doesn’t think it’s periodic fever syndrome. Some genetic testing has been done. Her antinuclear antibodies were positive once and negative when repeated, so they didn’t pursue that. Bloods have shown left shift neutrophils with toxic granulation, reactive lymphocytes, and microcytic red blood cells, but nobody has followed up on that. She’s also had three episodes of sterile pyuria with no further investigation. On top of all that, she gets these intermittent rashes.

We’re thinking about asking for a referral to a urologist or a rheumatologist next, but I’m not sure what makes the most sense. Has anyone dealt with anything similar or have advice on what kind of specialist might be helpful?

Gender: Male

Hello Everyone,
I have been facing a starburst vision problem for the past 3 years, especially in dark and low-light environments. It all started when I went to the eye hospital for a regular checkup and they dilated my eyes. It was my first time having an eye dilation test. They put a few drops to dilate my pupils, the doctor examined my eyes, and said everything looked fine.

However, my vision was fluctuating a lot—sometimes clear, sometimes blurry—so the doctor asked me to come back the next morning after the dilation wore off. After checking again, they said I had severe dry eye in my right eye and moderate dry eye in my left eye.

That same night, while my eyes were dilated, I saw big halos and starbursts around lights for the first time. I got a little worried but assumed it was just because of the dilation, so I ignored it. But even the next day, the starbursts were still there. I was prescribed prednisolone steroid drops and lubricating eye drops for two weeks and followed the treatment.

After two weeks, during the follow-up, the starburst was still present. I complained about it, and the doctors took it seriously. Many doctors examined my eyes and did different tests. Even the senior doctor of the hospital personally reviewed my case, but no one could find any issue. They said my eyes were healthy and that dry eye alone should not cause this problem. They advised me to ignore it and try to accept it.

Before the dilation, I never had any starburst problem. I used to drive at night and see lights normally. I only had occasional blur due to dryness, but no starbursts. After the dilation, I started seeing starbursts around lights. They look like rainbow colored spikes coming out of the light. There are no halos. The starburst changes size depending on my pupil size—when it’s very dark, it looks big, and in bright light or daytime, it’s barely noticeable. It is mostly visible from mid or far distance. I also noticed that when I turn on a flashlight near my eyes in the dark, the starburst becomes very small as my pupils shrink.

The doctors do not agree that this was caused by the dilation. Since then, whenever I go for eye checkups, I avoid dilation and explain my problem. I have also visited other eye doctors, but no one has been able to find the cause. Now it has been 3 years, and I am living with it and trying to accept it. The condition has not worsened and remains the same.

So my possible reasons for this problem are:

1. The dilation drops caused it.

2. The steroid drops used during the dilation period caused it.

3. The dilation triggered a hidden refractive issue.

If anyone knows what might be causing this or how to treat it, please help and provide a solution. I have always been worried about this. I try to ignore it and accept it, but it still gives me a lot of health anxiety.",,,,2025-12-07 21:00:50.044078+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-12-07 20:25:05,21699,7,,,"[""care_settings""]","[""starburst_vision"",""blurry_vision"",""dry_eyes""]","[""prednisolone"",""lubricating_eye_drops""]",[],[],"[""starburst vision"",""eye dilation test"",""dry eye"",""prednisolone steroid drops"",""rainbow colored spikes""]",not_relevant,0.9,Medical inquiry unrelated to bariatric surgery or PBH-specific context,patient,0.9,"[""Symptoms"",""Care Settings""]",concerned,,"[""concern"",""anxiety""]","[""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_care_settings_051"",""symptoms_starburst_vision_XXX"",""symptoms_blurry_vision_XXX"",""symptoms_dry_eyes_XXX"",""treatments_prednisolone_XXX"",""treatments_lubricating_eye_drops_XXX""]",,1765139105,,,

For the past 3-4 years, I have been experiencing this weird, uncomfortable, stuffy, dull, foggy feeling in my head. It makes it hard to focus and it's physically uncomfortable.

I used to experience a derealization a lot like 2,5 years ago but this is not it. (Therefore the reason why I am not sure whether it's psychological or physiological.) 
Sometimes it goes away, but mostly it's just... present, all the time. For some reason, it gets worse once it gets dark outside. 
The reason why I am asking for advice is that it's impossible to get rid of! Grounding exercises have no effect, good sleep schedule has no effect, changing or not taking medication have no effect...

Basically, around Augusty right leg started going numb and I had sharp stabbing nerve pain as well as back pain that also felt sharp and stubby. I would also have episodes of a wrapping pain in my back and abdomen. This was also when I started getting the more random but mainly right sided nerve pain especially weakness in my hands.

After a month or so, the leg pain basically left but the back didn’t. Eventually they both basically did but for the past 1-2 weeks I’ve been having another episode. This time it’s much more widespread and focused in my right hand. Weakness when carrying things, using a fork/chopsticks, even just raising my hand. I have this burning numbness. And then the left side of my body went numb for a few hours, after that I started having symptoms like this on my left, mainly in my arms still, though the nerve pain can be anywhere from my neck to my thighs, to my heels.

I know it’s nerve pain because it’s not permanent. My thumb could be burning and stabbing terribly but then I’ll feel it stop and my arm hurts more instead.

Through all of this I’ve also had terrible fatigue and brain fog.

I’m getting a spinal MRI Monday, and I want to know what to expect? A nerve compression? Herniated disk,.? Or worst case scenario a lesion? How likely are those? We learned about MS in school so it’s just at the back of my mind, constantly.

Consistent discomfort. 24f,"Info: 24f, 5'5ft, 115-120lbs? (I don't weigh myself often haha), only other condition is psoriasis

Hi there,

For the past one and a half years I've started to notice hip pain, mostly in my right hip but the discomfort is in both.

This year it's gotten really bad, and I've started to have this loud ""pop"" noise happen and then I keel over in pain and am limping for a while. It's worse when the weather is colder, and the limping/pain can last a whole day with repetitive cracking and popping. But it does happen year round, not just in winter.

I also have psoriasis, and I've also had very consistent pain flares in my right shoulder blade since I was 12-13 which my doctor examined and said it was slightly out of place.

I don't have any other immune conditions and am relatively healthy, but have noticed the hips are worse when my psoriasis is flaring.

I'm seeing my doctor in a month, but the pain has been really bad on and off this week so I'm wondering if there's any good at-home treatments or tests for hip pain for what this might ""possibly"" be.

I’m actually asking for my friend not myself. I’m a T1Diabetic and don’t know what “normal” is in non diabetic but my 17 year old brain says this sounds like reactive hypoglycemia…, patient is 30 year old female. 5’5”, normally around 110 lbs but recently dropped to ~102 lbs over the past 2 weeks. 


Here’s what she said “My doctor placed me on a continuous glucose monitor due to new symptoms, but won’t review the data until I’ve collected two full weeks. I’m hoping for some general guidance on whether the last 2 days of data look concerning.”

Symptoms (past 2 weeks):
– Feeling shaky, weak, and moody after eating
– Crushing fatigue immediately after meals
– Headaches after glucose drops
– “Chest tightness” that feels muscular, not cardiac
– Fine while fasting, symptoms start after food
– Weight loss despite eating ~2000 calories/day

Relevant medical history:
– Recurrent myopericarditis following COVID vaccine (on Arcalyst for 1.5 years, stable)
– ADHD on low-dose Jornay PM (20 mg for &gt;3 years, no side effects)
– No known autoimmune disease
– One cousin with Crohn’s disease
– Several relatives with type 2 diabetes
– No GI problems, no menstrual changes, no recent illness

What happened with the CGM:
This morning she did a home “glucose tolerance” test with 74g of carbs (orange soda) after a 12-hour fast. Her fingerstick and CGM matched well.

Her curve looked like this:
– Fasting: ~73 mg/dL
– 30 min: ~150 mg/dL
– 60 min: ~86–95 mg/dL
– 90 min: ~47–56 mg/dL (symptomatic)
– 120 min: low 80s without eating
– Took ~2 hours to feel somewhat normal again

Today and yesterday she’s also had several dips into the 60s after regular meals, even when eating balanced foods. She’s also had episodes where eating simple carbs (Oreos) caused no glucose spike at all. Symptoms feel disproportionate to the numbers, especially after the first drop.

The question:
While waiting for the doctor to review the full 2 weeks of CGM data, does this sound like typical reactive hypoglycemia in an underweight, insulin-sensitive person? Or does anything here warrant earlier follow-up? We’re not looking for a diagnosis — just an idea of whether this pattern is generally considered benign or something that needs sooner evaluation.

I’m eating normally and staying hydrated. No medication changes.

Thanks in advance for any insight — I’ll update with whatever my doctor says after the full review.

Just after some assistance wrapping my head around surplus/deficits please!

I know that any sort of surplus will eventually lead to gain no matter what, but it's more about how that translates into my situation.

The context: I'm 6'1"", 160lbs and I walk most days whilst eating at maintenance for the most part and including one cheat dinner and a couple of sweet treats throughout the week.

I was working out most days until about a month ago when I took a break to heal a tattoo. Got quite comfortable with not working out so much and, having replaced that with walking in the interim, seem to prefer just that with a reduction in calories consumed.

So, my question is, how much of a surplus does one need to be in to gain? All in all, I work it out to be between 2000 and 2500 calories a week at this rate. I think I'm underestimating calories burned if anything, but this is really a guide.

Meanwhile, at home I rarely even feel hungry, but I feel tense and heavy all the time. I’m starting to think stress might be a big factor. It’s like my body is constantly in fight-or-flight mode during term time, and everything slows down. On holiday my whole system finally chilled out.

I come from a very traditional, religious family that treats boys like kings, and girls as these delicate little creatures that basically are sheltered until a certain age. Cleaning the house, cooking, acting like a proper girl, being shy and demure, that is all part of the job. And the part I didn't follow apparently was being skinny and soft. For reference, my entire life I have been called fat by my family, in fact there have been about a thousand nicknames for me, just referencing my weight. So this past summer, before senior year, I wanted to remake myself. I no longer felt happy in my own body, even though I was in good health and was previously happy until all those years kinda caught up to me one day. So in two months, I went from 155 lbs - 125. I lost 30 lbs in two months and I did this for myself, but I knew that the nicknames and all the other things that were said to me growing up was a big part of the reason I wanted to lose weight. Now my family acts like I am some pariah. But they don't know what I went through to get to this weight that they are so very proud of. I made myself throw up after every meal. It didn't start out like that. I was genuinely doing well with my diet. Since I was a kid, I always liked walking and running, but because my family was strict, I was never allowed to be on the track team or any sports, so instead I walked inside my own house. Around 7 miles a day. During this time I started to lose weight, I went to about 15 miles of walking per day. And when I started making myself throw up, I couldn't stop. Even though my research told me it wouldn't help with my weight, I could not stop because whenever I eat, I felt so huge. And then so I wouldn't make myself throw up, I didn't eat at all. There would genuinely be days where I would not eat. I kept myself busy so I wouldn't be hungry.

So I am 5'5. For my height, I am at a very healthy weight, but now I feel the need to lose more, Maybe 120 or 110, and with my past behind me, I just feel tired, but at the same time, I feel ugly, unhealthy, and disgusted with myself.

I regret doing what I did, but what do I do now?

For background, I used to be a competitive cyclist and weighed about 145 at the time of my crash. I was about 15% body fat so I didn’t really have much to lose outside of muscle mass.

Since I’ve left the hospital, I’ve shot up in weight to around 180 due to being partially paralyzed so fairly sedentary, as well as not fully understanding how to eat with my new activity level. I’m now on a weight loss journey again with a goal weight of 150.

I don’t really have anyone in my life to share this with, so I’m posting it here because I’m genuinely proud of myself.

I’ve been trying to lose weight on and off for about 15 years. I’d jump into extreme diets, last maybe a week, then fall face-first into months of bingeing and burnout. It was the same cycle over and over, and I just kept piling the weight on

On April 25th this year, at 32, I stepped on the scale at my GP and weighed 314lb. I also found out I was pre-diabetic. My diet basically consisted of McDonald’s and multiple full-sugar Red Bulls every day. Realistically I wasn’t far from a heart attack and that scared me.

I decided I needed to get serious because I really don’t want to die before I even hit 40.

Fast forward just over 7 months and I’ve lost 104lbs. No magic hacks (despite how much I wanted that over the years), just a calorie deficit, walking 10k steps a day, and cutting Red Bull completely.

I still have about 60 to 70lbs to go, but I genuinely feel like a different person already.

And the funniest (and most annoying) part? Everyone was right. “Eat less, move more” actually works. It sucks when that’s not what you want to hear, but goddamn it works.

One thing I keep hearing about is eating in a calorie deficit. My younger sister hates the idea, but I’ve never had a problem with it. I was considering trying it, but she brought up something I hadn’t thought about.

I’m not saying I have an eating disorder, but I wouldn’t be shocked if I did. Overeating isn’t my issue — delayed eating is. Because of my medication, I get tired and sleep for long periods, or I don’t eat enough or have full meals. I also often feel guilty for eating if it’s after a certain time, like after 12 p.m., even though I can’t pinpoint exactly why I feel that way. I’ve even had moments where I had to talk myself into being okay with eating because it was late.

Now I’m not sure if a calorie deficit is healthy for me, because I already feel guilty about food so easily.

Hi everyone. Tomorrow I’m starting my weight loss journey. I want to lose weight and improve my health to make sure I’m around for my son as long as possible.

I have some new habits in mind to start. Staying under 1800 cal, playing more sports with my son, drinking 100 ounces of water. Fitting in YouTube workouts when I can, and then building upon those habits as I go. 

I’m going to the grocery store today to stock up on all my food for the week. Keeping it simple until I learn the ropes.

It is that time of year where it gets cold, lots of delicious food at gatherings, and it gets dark super early. I really do love this season but for some reason, I have lost that desire to keep going with my healthy eating routine and my exercise routine that I developed over the spring and summer months. 

I have tried changing up my routines to reflect this winter season but nothing has been sticking so far which is super hard. I want to keep with my strict healthy eating but comfort food has been winning in the end. Also once it is dark and cold in the evenings, I completely have lost my motivation to go for my long walks like I did in the summer, now I just want to curl up in a blanket the rest of the evening and put on some good Christmas movies. 

This is my first winter after losing a significant amount of weight so I am still trying to figure out how this works with a seasonal change as weight loss has to be a lifestyle change. It is discouraging that I still haven't found my sweet spot yet over this winter season for a healthy eating and exercise routine. I have already gained five pounds just from not being overly strict with tracking and indulging in the seasonal food so far. Just bogles my mind how quickly it can pack on over the winter but I was super highly active over the summer months so could get away with eating more. Therefore,

I was curious if it is normal to gain 5-10 pounds over the holidays/winter season and those who do gain winter weight, were you able to lose those 5-10 pounds once spring and summer came?

If it seems like I've put off going to the doctor on my new symptoms, it's because my tests almost always come back normal, and I have previously been diagnosed with GERD and PCOS due to lack of positive testing but undeniable presence of symptoms. I've had nearly constant depression with three major depressive episodes, anxiety, and insomnia since I was a teenager so my symptoms are usually dismissed as depression. However, my depression has been significantly better for the last seven months and I rarely experience days where I'm struggling with it.  I've had a lot of testing through a (new to me) primary care doctor and instacare doctor over the last few weeks and the primary care doctor doesn't want to do any other testing until I've done a sleep study. This post is because I have new symptoms this week and even more today and I'm trying to decide what to do about it. I plan on going to instacare in the morning, but I'm wondering if I should be taking this more seriously.

Current symptoms: general fatigue and muscles feeling weak over the last month, muscle cramps while sleeping and awake (this got better by eating bananas and taking potassium supplements), upper back muscles tingling nearly constantly, lips and nose either tingling or going numb every few days or after singing along with a song on the radio, previously occasional headaches have become daily, nausea nearly every day when I wake up or late in the day but no vomiting, loss of appetite, I've been finding large dark bruises on my legs and arms with nothing causing them, very light chest ache on the left side of my chest with occasional bursts of very light pain over the last week, and three moments of vertigo today plus stronger chest ache. Feels like a muscle knot but where my heart is, and it radiates very light pain occasionally.

The three episodes of vertigo today (not lightheaded, but like the world was spinning around me while I felt like I was falling, except I wasn't falling and I was only slightly leaning over) happened twice after waking up but before eating, then once again several hours later after eating a large meal.

For the last 10+ years, I've had an irregular menstrual cycle that worsened into periods that do not end. Shortest lastest a few months, longest lasted a year. Almost had to get a transfusion when I ended up in the ER for dizziness and shortness of breath due to iron-deficient anemia. Bleeding was constant but not a constant amount. Some times it would be spotting, sometimes it would be extremely heavy for several days or weeks. Only thing they could find during testing was small ovarian cysts. Got an IUD two years ago, still have spotting or bleeding nearly constantly (however much lighter than before, so it's manageable), but now I'm also having what seems like normal periods.

Testing done over the last few weeks:

CBC w/auto diff poct (Normal)

Basic Metabolic Panel poct (Normal)

Vitamin B12 (Normal)

TSH with reflex to free t4 (normal)

T4, Free, Direct (normal)

Urinalysis poct (*Abnormal: cloudy appearance, dark yellow, large blood/urine, Trace leukocytes, 30 protein, 40 ketones, all other results normal*.)



I had a CT Brain/Head w/o contrast done in January looking for possible tumors due to my last major depressive episode, with a finding of ""no acute intracranial abnormality.""

I have been dieting for the last few months and lost 12 lbs, however while the diet outline is strict, I have not been strict with it. I stick to this during my work week (four days) then eat mostly this diet but with some of my normal foods as well on the weekends (poke bowls, brown sugar boba, takoyaki, fried chicken tenders or fish and chips). The diet is to eat only proteins, non starch vegetables, and occasionally low sugar fruits, no grains. We usually eat eggs, dairy products, mixed berries, avocados, grilled steak, grilled chicken, sauteed tilapia, mixed vegetables that are not mainly starch, mixed green salads with no dressing. I've noticed this diet lets me live without my GERD symptoms and is a lot better for my depression as well. For the last few weeks I've been taking a 'multi for her' daily vitamin, vitamin D3 supplements 5000 iu due to my high altitude state and the above abnormal test result, and recently added magnesium and potassium supplements due to my doctors recommendation to help with sleep and muscle cramps.

I would row 30k a week, and within one year I weighed 190 lbs. at 21 I faced my fears and began bulking, wanting to get stronger I would lift weights 6 days a week and row 10k a day. By the end of the year I was 220, strong, vascular, abs, and felt great about myself. 

Then I hit 23, from 23 to 24 my weight varied between 230-270. I lost interest in working out, I would drink beer and cocktails far too often and lost most of my strength. At 25 I decided to try to get back to it, but it was 100x harder than I thought. I had completely lost the drive I once had.

Now at 26 I feel lost. I weighed 270 when I turned 26, I decided to start slowly and walk after work (usually on the golf course) and ended up walking 100 miles a month for 5 months. I dropped to 245.  I got a gym membership one month ago and have been slowly getting into it. I’ve been rowing 5k minimum everyday and have the usual “bro” split (chest, back,legs) it has not been easy, knowing where I’ve been and how I’ve felt when I was in shape. It might be unrealistic but I am determined to get back to 210lbs by May. Finding the passion is difficult, but I try my best to go back to the gym daily. It is just so hard to think I lost all that weight, and in a couple of years fucked it up.

She took me to the gym today (my first time going) and helped me stock up on vitamins and protein shakes because I start medication on Monday to help load the weight. I see how she lives her life. Shes motivated, happy, everything looks great on her. I don’t resent her for being healthy, I want to be a healthy best friend for her. I want to be healthy at my wedding. I’m so depressed from gaining so much. At the gym I couldn’t do half the basic starter exercises she was doing. She’s been so supportive. Half this post is about how much i love her lol. But onto the actual issue I need advice on: how can i build healthy habits when my mental health is awful because of my weight right now? Obviously it’s not just my weight (I don’t have a job and have too many cats lol) but it’s almost all directly tied to my weight. I feel horrible. I’m in pain. My confidence is destroyed. I have a loving support system and YES I’m in therapy. But when I look at myself I just feel so much shame of letting myself get to the point I’m at. I know I can get it off, but I’m scared of being on medication forever just to keep the weight off. I’m scared I’ll still be unhappy and in pain when I lose the weight. I’m scared that when I’m finally better, and can eat one cookie without eating the whole box, I’ll look back and realize I wasted so much of my life beacuse my weight kept me in bed.

I was never able to fully gain the weight back despite tracking my calories and meal planning for over a year, sitting at around 100lbs, and then 90lbs further into my 20s.

I’ve never had a particularly strong appetite (I use medical marijuana to help) but am also not especially active; I work a full-time desk job 5 days a week, occasionally go on hikes. 
I’ve gone to plenty of doctor’s appointments for general checkups where they weighed me at 90lbs and they never brought it up as a concern, so I wasn’t concerned.

However, I weighed myself about a week ago and was shocked to see I was 82lbs. I don’t look like I’ve lost any weight visually, and even started some (*very*) light weightlifting recently—we’re talking 10lb weights.
The only medication I take daily is folic acid for a genetic blood disorder, and occasional supplements (ashwagandha for libido/stress).

Hi all. I thought I’d ask here as multiple visits to the hospital has got us none the wiser, just on the off-chance someone has experienced the same. My boyfriend (25M) has had a cough for five weeks now. He was prescribed antibiotics two weeks in, but the symptoms didn’t subside. He was then given another type of antibiotic, and again, it didn’t go. As he got worse he was sent to the emergency A&amp;E where they carried out heart tests, blood tests and X-rays. However, there was no sign of an infection. They decided to give him doxycycline, but his condition got worse. 

He has been unable to carry out basic tasks like washing or making food, without throwing up or almost passing out. He also has no appetite because of the nausea. I took him to the hospital as they told him to come back. They carried out the same tests and everything came back fine, which puzzled the doctors as he was visibly unwell (shaking, sweating, pale as a sheet). They said his temperature was normal and yet his feet were extremely hot and the rest of him, cold and clammy. The only thing they found was that his heart rate would spike from 70 to 120 upon moving. 

They concluded to take him off the doxycycline as the vomiting was making the chest pain worse. They told him to rest but he’s been doing that for five weeks now. And I know he’s not exaggerating as he usually works with colds and sickness and it doesn’t affect him.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated as I’m getting very worried. We’re in the UK. I have not (touch wood), caught whatever he has over the past five weeks.

I’m 27 with a minimal (read: 3 in all my life) history of migraines until I started experiencing neurological symptoms three months ago, starting with a limp and progressing to where we are now. I am in a wheelchair, I collapse daily, my right eyelid gets droopy, my cognition and memory are so poor I can’t follow basic instructions and my speech is often slurred. And, I started getting migraines with increasing frequency and severity. And now they’re giving me psychosis.

Quick timeline:
17th Nov: I tell the doctor I have increasingly frequent and painful migraines and she prescribes sumitriptan
20th Nov: I have a migraine, take sumitriptan and start rambling about “UFO Jesus” and how I “can’t die because I’m not old”. My husband and I think I had an adverse reaction to sumitriptan so I resolve not to take it again. 

2nd dec: next migraine. No medication. Psychosis is worse. I think Hitler is in my room and that he’s possessing me. I’m scared but due to the pain, as I haven’t taken any medication, I can’t talk to try to get him to go away. I lie in bed scared with my eyes absolutely burning on ChatGPT of all things trying to ask it how to make Hitler go away. 

Tonight, 6 Dec: the worst one yet. I took sumitriptan as I realised it does not protect me from the psychosis and just made it more physically painful. The psychosis was… a lot. There’s a video on my phone of me addressing the “kuffar” (non-Muslims. I am an atheist who has never been a Muslim) telling them to read the Quran written by “john”. My cat walked into the room as I was filming and I think she’s Jesus coming to praise me for spreading the word of Islam. Then, I go on Twitter to upload the video to “spread the word” when I see a picture of Hitler. I get stopped cold in my tracks thinking “Hitler is back”. I become terrified and desperate for him to leave me alone. I search everywhere for ways to contact Hitler to make him leave me alone. Eventually I find a record of a phone number he reportedly used. It contained my birthdate: 116 (I’m European, so 116 = 11th June), so I was even more scared he was after me. Needless to say, this number does not work and absolutely does not connect you to Hitler, but I frantically called it seven times to try to talk to him and beg him to leave me alone. 

Eventually I become more lucid and realise I’ve texted my mum and husband a string of messages begging them to make Hitler leave me alone. My husband had texted asking if I wanted him to call an ambulance and I said no because “I couldn’t contact Hitler on there”. 

I have NO history of psychosis and NEVER experience psychosis outside of migraines. It happens whether or not I take sumitriptan. 
The ER here turn you away unless you’re either clearly dying or old - sounds like a joke, genuinely is not. They won’t even examine you if you’re young and still breathing.

Just, please, someone tell me what the hell this migraine psychosis is about because I’m terrified.

I have no other bad symptoms apart from the visibility of it. She flag it as non-urgent and hence, my appointment to see the specialist is not immediate. 

I’m thinking of rescheduling my appointment next Monday as I have urgent work that doesn’t allow me to take leave but this would mean that I might delay it for another month due to it being a public hospital.

Recently, I had a health scare where I thought I had colon cancer. I have been doing great for the last year mental health wise and physical wise up until now. Out of nowhere, I started having really random episodes of scary symptoms (dizziness, racing heart, full body tingling, lower left abdomen/rectal pain, diarrhea) for several weeks, and I dialed it down to my panic attacks relapsing/something internal triggering this anxiety. Visited my PCP and they found some stuff that was mildly concerning, so they ordered tests and scans. 

Did a CT scan and the scan didn’t find anything related to cancer (other gynecological things were found— massive fibroid and ovarian cysts. I have an appt scheduled soon for a gyno.)

The thing is now, during that time period where I was waiting for CT results + following up with my doctor, I was horrified of colon cancer. I’m still convinced I have something terrible going on related to foods that’s been triggering the anxiety. I’ve only purchased organic foods for the last several weeks now, and I have dropped several pounds over the last several weeks because I’m afraid to eat a lot of foods.

I had been to ENT, allergists, PCPs, urgent cares, etc with no answers, either treated with antibiotics or steroids and it worked and I was fine and then weeks later it would start again. I was sick in the beginning of November and I I started feeling sick again. Here’s where it’s different this time and I need some insight to see if my line of thought is correct. (I am an EMT, so I have some background in medicine). I went to a patients residence in Thursday that reeked of household cleaners. The artificial scents were choking. I started to develop a cough after that. I’ve been off since Friday. Friday I spent all day coughing, and spitting clear mucus off the back of my throat. Today I’ve been extremely tired, I have a headache, my sinuses are swollen and I’m still hacking up lots of clear mucus except in the morning when it had a slight yellow tinge to it. I feel like I’m sick, yet it almost presents like allergies and do to a possible irritating/cause it’s making me lean that way this time. When I would really get into a coughing fit with some force I could kind of taste that infection taste from deep, but nothing came up. I haven’t taken allergy meds consistently since about January due to being on them chronically for so long. I’ve taken my albuterol inhaler once yesterday which I hadn’t needed in a really long time. Any thoughts on this? Allergies or yet another URI? The last one cleared on its own in 2 weeks itself, and another week of just hacking crap up.

I’m hoping there is someone here that can help me understand my DNA test results, as my follow-up appointment with my neurologist isn’t until mid February. 

I had my DNA sequenced after a 6 year long diagnostic fight ending in a diagnosis of Myofascial Pain Syndrome. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning I have been tested for every other possibility they could think of to explain my chronic pain. 

I’m a 33 year old woman and my pain started in 2018. First it was tension headaches, plantar fasciitis, and weakness in the neck. By 2021 my symptoms had worsened and started to include muscle cramps, fatigue, and constant underlying pain. In 2022 my symptoms increased sharply, and the aching in my muscles started to consume my thoughts and prevent me from sleeping. I started doing yoga and using foam rollers to briefly decrease the pain. In 2023 I had another sharp increase with muscle spasms, intensified fatigue, a constant sensation of a knife stabbing in my shoulder, and a burning in my hips/back. I started my diagnostic journey then. In 2025 my pain and exhaustion has gotten so severe that I am no longer able to work normally. 

I’ve had MRIs, X-rays, have been tested for “every” autoimmune disease (negative, but did have a low positive ANA), and various neurological tests. My doctor diagnosed me with MPS early in 2025 and suddenly everything made sense. All of my symptoms fell in line and I felt like I had my answers. 

My sister had tested positive for three potentially serious blood clotting genetic conditions, so I wanted to be tested as well. There can also be a genetic basis to MPS so we did a full muscular disease panel with it. I got the results of that panel last night. 

Three genetic defects came up, and upon googling, all three of them are linked to fatal muscular conditions (CCDC78, DES, and GAA). My results were labeled as “uncertain”, and my doctor said we’d follow up in February. I’m driving myself crazy with the possibilities. 

What could these results mean for me? What are my potential nexts steps? I am certainly in a lot of pain, but don’t feel like I’m actively dying. I don’t generally have any respiratory or GI symptoms, uncoordination, or vision/hearing problems. 

My sister is undiagnosed except for the blood clotting disorders, but she has many other unexplained symptoms (dissimilar to mine, except for the low positive ANA). Our parents are healthy and our family has only had standard American diagnoses (heart disease, arthritis, cancers, high blood pressure, strokes, and the like). 

I have no other known physical conditions, but do have depression, OCD, and a history of disordered eating. I currently take Prozac (depression), valacyclovir (chronic cold sores), gabapentin (pain and neuropathy), B12 (chronic deficiency), clindamicin and metronidazole (rosacea), birth control, and lysine, biotin, and fiber (supplements). 

I have tried to give all relevant information, but let me know if there’s something I missed. Thank you so much for any insight!

I closed my eyes and immediately fell into this dreamlike experience where I was at my pediatrician again. I wasn't asleep, though, I wasn't alert either.

I don't remember what happened clearly but, I felt terrified during it. When I was a kid, at my physicals, the pediatrician would conduct physical exams of me. I'd have to get undressed into a gown and lay on the table, and he'd come and examine my body.

He'd pull aside my undergarments and touch my chest and pubic area. It was like a palpating touch. It would all last maybe 5-10 minutes. I think he'd check my heartbeat and breathing too. I'd get dressed behind the curtain after it was done. I hated doing this. I'd just freeze up while it happened. But I was told I had to do it to make sure I was developing normally. Early puberty ran in my family. I had my first period when I was 8 or 9, I think.

Sometimes he'd press hard enough on my pubic area that it hurt. Is this normal practice? The same thing was done with my sister too, she's 3 years younger than I am. I remember wondering why he ended needed to touch me the way he was. But I figured he had some medical reason - right?

Edit: I can't remember if he would just draw the curtain or if my mom would leave the room for this. I know as I got older I wanted her to leave while it happened. I think this was done up until I was a teenager, but I don't know when I stopped getting them exactly. I switched to an adult primary doctor when I turned 18.

Hi, so I have begun introducing allergens to my son, 7 months old, (we started when he was six months). We’ve done peanut, sesame, soy, egg, tree nuts and also dairy so far. However, I’ve specifically been giving him A2 dairy yogurt or a little of my A2 milk mixed-in with his purées because he’s sensitive to the proteins in A1 dairy, like his dad.

A little background: My husband thought he was lactose intolerant for the longest time until we realized he’s absolutely fine with anything made with only A2 dairy (butter doesn’t seem to matter but definitely things like milk, cheese and yogurt do). I’m breastfeeding and noticed that my son would spit up if I consumed regular milk and cheese so I switched to exclusively A2 milk for my drinks and only eat goat cheese and no surprise, he doesn’t spit up at all now. Sometimes he has a little formula and even that is Bub’s A2 Goat Milk.

My concern here is… if he’s not getting exposure to A1 protein dairy, could that potentially put him at risk of developing an allergy as opposed to just a sensitivity later down the road? Because if so, I’d rather he spits up a little (since babies do that anyway) than have an actual allergy later in life because almost all dairy products here in the US have A1 proteins.

Would love any thoughts on this. I’m going to be asking his pediatrician at our next appointment but I have a feeling he might not be sure about this himself since I know most people don’t know about the A1 and A2 protein difference in the first place.",,,,2025-12-07 03:00:46.670494+00,5,0,null,en,1,2025-12-07 00:36:59,21632,7,,,"[""care_settings""]","[""spit_up""]","[""A2_milk"",""goat_milk_formula""]","[""dairy_sensitivity""]",[],"[""introducing allergens to infant"",""A1 vs A2 dairy proteins"",""dairy sensitivity"",""spit up with A1 dairy"",""A2 milk and goat cheese""]",not_relevant,0.9,Post discusses infant allergen exposure unrelated to bariatric or PBH-specific context.,patient,0.8,"[""Symptoms"",""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Care Settings"",""Treatments""]",neutral,,"[""curiosity""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""topics_care_settings_051"",""symptoms_spit_up_999"",""treatments_A2_milk_999"",""treatments_goat_milk_formula_999"",""conditions_dairy_sensitivity_999""]",,1765067819,,,

About a year ago and 3 months ago I had sex with a new partner that resulted in me developing folliculitis in my pubic hair region within 24-36 hours after exposure. I never developed postules in that area. Just redness around the hair follicle, especially if it was a new hair sprouting out. Occasionally I would get mosquito looking lesions on the hair follicles. Eventually all of this spread to my back and scalp. I would also get small boils especially on my back and lower thigh/buttocks region. Lots of itching, burning, crawling and pain on the affected areas

I got the pus of a postule on my scalp PCR Tested for various type of bacteria (including gram negative and fungi) and it came back for positive only for C.Acnes and CoNS (coagulase-negative staphylococci). Though it didn't differentiate what type.

Is it possible to develop a staph infection from a coagulase-negative staphylococci species? Does this sound like a staph infection to ya'll? staph lugdunensis is CoNS and apparently pathogenic.

Any help is appreciated. I am done sulking over this and am determined to solve this. I am on day 3/14 of doxycycline while also applying Mupirocin to my nose and ears as well as topical clindamycin to the folliculitis prone areas. Doing Benzoyl Peroxide and Hibleclens in the shower as well as taking the MB40 probiotic. Not a major difference so far but its still early. I'll keep being consistent. Might ask for a longer course.

Last Saturday evening, I went to bed and noticed that my right big toe was sore and slightly red. By the time I woke up Sunday, my toe was swollen and noticeably infected. By that evening, I had been prescribed 6 pills of Bactrim by a doctor. I took the pills and come Wednesday, the infection was worse. It was still sore, still red, leaking a clear/amber hued fluid, I had no appetite, I had an elevated temp (not a fever, but was around 99.7 at its highest) that never got lower than 99 oral temp, and I was lethargic so then I then got prescribed 14 pills of Clindamycin 300mg. 

As I’ve taken the Clindamycin, my symptoms have improved a decent amount however it’s still not fully healed after 4 days on the Clinda. My redness is a lot less as well as the swelling, however it is still leaking a translucent fluid if I push on it, and is still sore. My appetite has come back thankfully and I’m not near as fatigued. My temp the last two days has been between 98.7-99.5, so less but still not near what my normal resting of 97.5 is. 

Tomorrow is my final day of Clindamycin, if it’s not healed by tomorrow, the fifth and final day of my meds, does that mean I need to go to a hospital for emergency treatment since the Clindamycin didn’t fully get rid of it, or is the fact I’ve had a soft tissue infection for a full week enough reason to worry and go to a hospital? 

I don’t have insurance nor any money for an urgent care visit so that’s not an option, it’d have to be the ER. Will post multiple pictures in, labeled with what day they were taken.

ER #1 diagnosed ""Comminuted/Displaced."" ER #2 (Level 1 Trauma) diagnosed ""Greenstick"" and casted. Am I overreacting to the diagnosis discrepancy?","Demographics:
​Age/Sex: 6F
​Medical History: Healthy, strong athlete.
​Activity Level: Training Gymnast (USAG Level 2/3).
​Physical Conditioning: High level of upper body strength and conditioning. She has significant training in ""safe falling"" techniques and proprioception. She is not a novice; she knows how to land and bail safely, which makes the severity of this break highly unusual.
​Pain Tolerance: Extremely high/stoic. Masks pain in public.

​Images: https://imgur.com/a/gk9hPma
(Please compare Image 1,2,3: Pre-reduction vs. Image 3,4: Post-reduction. All xrays are from local hospital ER visit; night of the injury)


The injury occurred on 12/3/25. She was performing a modified back handspring over an octagon barrel. This is a training drill where the barrel supports the back to reduce impact on the wrists compared to a floor skill. The injury happened on a professional spring floor (from bottom to top: springs + fiberglass panels + 2-inch foam mats + carpet). This surface is specifically engineered to absorb shock.
Despite the shock-absorbing floor and the safety barrel, she suffered a catastrophic failure of the arm. There was a loud ""snap"" heard across the gym.

​Timeline:
​1. ER Visit #1 (Local Hospital) - 12/3 Evening
​X-Rays: Showed complete snapping/overlap.
​Radiology Report: ""Comminuted, displaced and angulated fractures of the proximal to mid radius and ulnar shafts"".
​Action: Attempted reduction, splinted, and referred us for surgery/specialist due to instability.

​2. ER Visit #2 (Level 1 Pediatric Center) - 12/4 Afternoon
​The Transfer Issue: The hospitals did not communicate directly. I used a patient portal app (PocketHealth) to fax the records to ER #2 myself from my phone.
​The Review: ER #2's chart notes ""XR Consult Of Outside Films Pediatric"". However, I'm unsure if I only faxed the post reduction pictures I did not get to see what they received.
​Triage: My daughter had pain meds on board and masks pain well. She told the nurse she was ""fine,"" leading to a low-priority triage.
​Diagnosis: They removed the splint, saw the alignment was poor, re-reduced it, and casted her. The discharge diagnosis was ""Greenstick fracture"" (incomplete break).
Red Flag: The Doctor who performed the reduction mentioned because she's so young that her bones are good at resculpting themselves. He said that the BONE FRAGMENTS were a good thing and to keep them in to help her bones form again. No surgery needed. 


​My Questions for the Physicians:

Can a fracture that was ""Comminuted/Displaced"" physically become a ""Greenstick"" 24 hours later? Or does the ""Greenstick"" label suggest they missed the initial severity because they only saw the arm after it was splinted/straightened by the first ER?

Could it be possible that the first ER OD was way off base?  

Can bone fragments be present  in Greenstick fractures? When I look at the xrays I'm not understanding the greenstick diagnosis; what makes a fracture communited vs greenstick?

​Given that she is a gymnast who puts 100% of her weight on her arms, is a cast sufficient for whatever fracture she may have? I am terrified of the bones slipping in the first week and healing with a slight malunion that prevents tumbling (rotation).

​Does this warrant checking for bone density issues, or is this just a ""wrong angle, wrong force"" freak accident?

With only using a split cast what are the chances she steps back out onto the gymnastics floor only to immediately refracture? (after the appropriate amount of healing time and the go ahead from doctor of course)

​I have a follow-up in 7 days at a satellite location. Is this diagnosis discrepancy something I need to be firmly advocating about or am I overreacting?

Had some sensitivity i noticed in the bum area, bent over and looked in a mirror and its quite red and seemingly rashy. Around the anus in a big red and irritated circle into the buttcrack. About the size of a palm. (just red, no puss, no boils or pimples; just rashy red color.) 

I do have mild history of hemorrhoids which i have a cream i use as needed. I had very mild diarrhea a few days ago (nothing serious at most just a little bug) but it did cause me to use the cream which i previously never had issues to. Yesterday i did not use the cream nor did i today because just by sensation wondered if the cream irritated me. But i didnt check until today.

I am unsure if this is plausibly a reaction to the creme which i never had before or just a general sensitivity of the skin from wiping? Idk. 

Its not painful and hardly noticeable if i dont think about it. But it does sting/burn a little bit and is sensitive to wipe when i go. 

I do not believe it has any likelihood whatsoever of being an sti.

So could it be allergy/irritation? Should i add the creme because it reduces inflammation or avoid it. Could i add hydrocortisone cream? (not internally only external)

Should i just avoid the area. What are signs its fungal or something else is my biggest concern. To my knowledge i never had a fungal issue in my life.

These white spots look like they’re under the skin too, which stones are usually exposed.

It's firm, dosent shift around much when pinched and it dosent hurt. I spoke to some friends who may think it's either a cyst of some sort or a rare possibility of it being a tumor based off the context of the rate it's grown. A month ago(approximately) it was roughly 1mm in size I noticed it while changing my earnings(I've got a double piercing). However, a few weeks later I've noticed its grown to 7mm to 8mm in size. My friends told me to try an squeeze it hard, I did and yet it's quite firm, almost like cartilage? After a few hours of personal research(I didn't use any ai run sites.) I decided to peirce the skin with a sanitised needle to see if any puss or liquid might come out. After several attempts to pierce it, there was zero pain and zero blood, and no liquid or puss. The strangest part was the fact that once I peirced the skin the needle would not go through the lump no matter the force I used. Again, there was no pain at all and absolutely no blood.

Im on zero medications. I do however have an small acne problem so it may be correlated to that?

So this year I've been noticing some changes, I hesitate to call them symptoms because for all I know it could be health anxiety, which has never really been a problem for me until my mom passed a few years ago. 

  
Weight Loss:  This time last year I was 263, today I weighed in at 239. I do tend to fluctuate 5-6 pounds a week.  Now a bit of background on that...I drank extremely heavily from August 2024 through July of this year then drastically cut down since then.  I was consuming at least a 12 pack of lite beer a day plus 2 packs of cigarettes during that time.  At this point, IF I drink at all it may be one binge a month, so obviously my caloric intake has been reduced tremendously just with the drinking problem being taken care of.  However, that has been the only change in lifestyle except a very recent uptake in exercise (just the last month to 6 weeks).  That amount of weight loss has me concerned even though I have heard from many places and sources that you will drop a ton of weight once becoming sober from alcohol. I've noticed my shoulders and cheeks look more boney than they have in the past.

Significant increase in oily skin on the face:  This I've noticed for about a year and honestly its more oily now than when I was a teenager, especially upon waking up.  This is limited to the nose and the forehead.

Fasciculations: Dr. Google has not been kind with this one, suggesting horrible diseases like ALS or MS.  I have muscle fasciculations almost daily and can experience them almost everywhere. Calves, thighs, buttocks, chest, abdomen, forearms and upper arms (mostly triceps).  Very rarely I do feel something in the tongue but I wouldn't call it a fasciculation but it feels more like an electrical shock on the right side of the tongue.  The fasciculations in the muscles are NOT constant and do NOT occur in multiple muscles simultaneously and are typically one and done or at the most a cluster of 4-5 in a row before stopping for a while. A while could be a few hours or a few days.  My doctor said it's probably depleted B vitamins due to the drinking and suggested taking B Complex which has helped a lot but did not eliminate them.

Likely Spermatocele: This I first noticed in 2020, Urologist felt it in 2020 said nothing to worry about. Since then it has grown substantially to about the size of the testicle itself.  PCP felt it last year and said ""I don't feel any tumor"".  No pain or soreness involved with it and I can shine a light straight through it leading me to believe it's fluid filled and not solid.

Loss of muscle mass:  I attributed this to the drinking and have recently started lifting weights in the last month.  I do notice since then I am gaining some size slowly and my arms are much harder than they were over the summer.   I would assume with a serious condition like ALS it would be impossible to build muscle even if you tried consistently.  

Known medical conditions:  High BP (treated with Nifedipine), high cholesterol (treated with Atorvastatin), sleep apnea (on CPAP).

I do bloodwork on my own once a quarter to keep up on things and everything is always within normal range.  Chest X-Ray in July 2025 was clear, ECG and stress test normal.

So what do you all think?  Common sense tells me cutting 8000 calories a week in beer out of my diet plus not ordering the 3-4X a week fast food during drunken binges is responsible to the weight loss and that the heavy drinking is probably responsible for the muscle loss but as you know Dr. Google will mess with your mind.",,,,2025-12-07 03:00:46.670494+00,0,0,null,en,4,2025-12-07 01:24:39,21619,7,,,"[""diagnostics_monitoring"",""care_settings""]","[""weight_loss"",""oily_skin"",""muscle_fasciculations"",""muscle_loss""]","[""nifedipine"",""atorvastatin"",""B_complex"",""CPAP""]","[""high_bp"",""high_cholesterol"",""sleep_apnea"",""spermatocele""]",[],"[""weight loss"",""oily skin"",""muscle fasciculations"",""spermatocele"",""cutting alcohol"",""B complex vitamins"",""muscle mass gain""]",not_relevant,0.9,Post discusses general health concerns unrelated to bariatric or PBH-specific context.,patient,0.8,"[""Symptoms"",""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Diagnostics"",""Treatments"",""Care Settings""]",neutral,,"[""anxiety"",""curiosity""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""topics_diagnostics_monitoring_036"",""topics_care_settings_051"",""symptoms_weight_loss_999"",""symptoms_oily_skin_999"",""symptoms_muscle_fasciculations_999"",""symptoms_muscle_loss_999"",""treatments_nifedipine_999"",""treatments_atorvastatin_999"",""treatments_B_complex_999"",""treatments_CPAP_999"",""conditions_high_bp_999"",""conditions_high_cholesterol_999"",""conditions_sleep_apnea_999"",""conditions_spermatocele_999""]",,1765070679,,,

My father, Male 63 had a hemorrhagic stroke last Sunday. He was on an upward trajectory. His brain bleed was stable and he was starting to regain movement with some light therapy in hospital. Last night he had went into VTach after aspirating on some spit.  He was getting CPR for 17 minutes when they finally restarted his heart. He’s currently intubated and they’re keeping him sedated but having trouble because if they sedate him too much, his BP drops to extremely low and if he’s awake, it’s up around 200 and he’s very agitated 

At this time, the doctors are trying to decide if they want to put him on blood thinners to treat his heart condition and risk another hemorrhagic stroke or not. 

I have some general questions that, but have been having some trouble pinning down a doctor to ask. The nurses have been great answering what they can be they tend to couch their answers in ifs and maybes 

1. Right now his eyes are open but glassy. Is he aware of things or in a twilight? 

2. He’s responsive to pain and has movement on his left side. He’s responding to commands, I think? No doctor has really said. The side that was unaffected by the stroke. All of these to me signal that he’s brain is still working somewhat but it doesn’t preclude him from having deficits, correct? 

3. To me it seems like none of this is going to kill him imminently. But obviously he is very precarious. If they don’t decide to treat with blood thinners. Is that them throwing in the towel? Or more “let’s see if his condition improves enough to try later” I’m sure this is harder to answer because obviously you’re not on his care team. But I’m trying to understand where he’s at so I can help prepare my mom. 

4. This is more personal and I completely understand if you’d prefer to ignore this so feel free. The doctors broached a DNR should he have another cardiac event. My mom is inclined to sign it from her side. I’m hesitating to support her (not that I have a choice in the matter) because I’m seeing him respond to stimulus and his eyes open and stuff. Is that a bad assumption?

Our boy has been prone to every illness under the sun this year since starting daycare, winter was particularly brutal with everything from HFM, croup, Flu A, pneumonia and all the follow up ear and throat infections that came with those.

He is currently fighting another daycare virus which has given us our 5th bout of croup - he is on redipred 3ml once a day for 3 days with no trouble, it sorts him out well after the 2nd dose. The cough has already calmed down a lot but he is looking extremely pale in his face, like a mask around the eye sockets/side of his face. He is also drooling a lot and seems to be choking/coughing on the drool. Eating and drinking okay, playful, alert, can tell he’s got a cold but otherwise he’s presenting fine.

He gets this every time he is slightly unwell but it is quite extreme and very noticeable as his normal colouring is naturally olive.

We have had his iron checked and he takes a multi including iron every morning.

Pulse ox 98 with the pale face, no blue lips or anything concerning just the very croupy cough and slight wheeze which he gets almost every time he has any upper respiratory symptoms. 

Is it normal to lose most of the colour in your face every time you catch any sort of illness or is this an indicator of something that we would need to look into?

I was smelling candles and one accidentally touched my lip. I pulled it away quickly and thought nothing of it. When I got home I noticed my top lip was starting to tingle, burn and itch. My mom said my top lip looked swollen. I thought it was an allergic reaction so I tried to let it pass. Thanksgiving it was okay but noticed little bumps that looked like water blisters. Got really irritated towards the end of the night and when I checked my lips on the inside on top lip it was raw and lightly bleeding. 

Went into urgent care thinking I had gotten an infection from the candle touching my lip. She said everything looked fine and since it was a quick touch that it most likely wasn’t contact dermatitis. Basically I had chapped lips and needed to up my hydration, and no scented lip balm. Started using Vaseline which helped. Fast forward to yesterday and I noticed it starting to tingle again. 

It hurts to open my mouth to eat. My top lip feels so tight, dry, tingles and itches. I put on Vaseline and it soothes it a bit before it tingles. The inner top lip feels raw. My bottom lip doesn’t burn, tingle, feel tight or dry. Thinking of going back to urgent care but I can’t really afford it right now. I know it’s only been a week but it’s a little painful to eat. Is it truly chapped lips or can it be something else?

No one else in my family feels this way and Ive barely been around other people so a cold seems unlikely and I’m getting myself worked up thinking I have some serious issue going on, I also checked my body temperature with a body thermometer at home, I put it in my underarm and it keeps staying around 35-35.1 degrees Celsius but google keeps saying thats bad.

I saw a post on another fitness sub a couple days ago about how for many women being thin especially without muscle isn’t the easiest or healthiest long term fitness goal. I don’t know what happened to it, I think OP may have deleted it because of the of backlash it got. But honestly, it really spoke to me. It made me cry a little bit because right now I am really struggling to maintain my weight loss, and it sucks because I thought I’d finally be happy with my dream body. 

Like for the first time in my life I finally like the way I look but I’m finding it so hard to continue on like this. I’m currently 95 lbs at 5 ft tall which is in the healthy range for my height but I’m struggling so badly for some reason. There’s been a nagging voice at the back of my head telling me I need to start eating more and building some muscle and that this would be easier on me in the long run than trying to continue being on the thinner side but it’s like I can’t bring myself to.

Sometimes I wish there were more people in my life to encourage me to gain some weight back &amp; do some strength training, and tell me that I don’t need to be thin but so many people in my life compliment me on how slender I am now and tell me how great I look. I wish I could tell them how miserable I feel despite how great I look. How I don’t have the energy to do much of anything. How weak I feel. I’m so afraid of undoing the work I did to become smaller.

No matter what I do, my blood sugar is high.
Tests are done first thing in the morning, before breakfast.

I've tried 20g total carbs/220g protein but learned there is a protein limit.
I've done 70g total carbs/140g protein and it's still around 160 in the morning. 

Any tips on things to be aware of and how to get this lower?

I always check with the fingerstick and it confirms I am indeed low.

I have had three episodes this week alone where my phone rang multiple times in the night to say that I was low. I was hoping it would just be a false low only to find out it wasn’t. On one of them I even skipped it because I was too tired. When I told my Endo, she got on my ass about that because she said that one of these days if I skip a low alert I could end up not waking up ever again.

The first couple of weeks I was in denial, but then I made the appointment and was put on metformin and atorvastatin, and I cut out all refined carbs and sweet treats. 

Last week I had my labs done to see where I’m at, and holy cow I was not expecting how much of an improvement I was going to see! My a1c is now at a 5.6 (out of even a prediabetic range), glucose from 108 to 85, and my cholesterol that was originally at 190 was now down to 85, with everything else back in the green as well (except my HDL was slightly lower, but my Dr. says it’s because of the total cholesterol having dropped so much). 

Physically wise I feel so much better; my joints don’t hurt like they have for years, the swelling in my legs have decreased majorly (my compression socks keep sliding down as a result), and any swelling that does happen isn’t as intense or goes away a lot faster. I have lost 30 pounds since I started and have actually gone down a size in clothes, and keeping my pants up alone has become a daily workout with how often I’m having to pull them up (I wear sweats because jeans don’t breath enough for me). Overall I’ve been able to walk so much more, especially since I haven’t been in as much pain, and plan to start going to the gym again because I miss lifting weights like I used to and want to build my strength back up again. 

Honestly as much as a frustration as it can be at times, I’m actually glad I got my diagnosis. It made me finally get my act together and start realizing how much I was hurting my body just for a few minutes of pleasure from a slice of cake or candy bar…only it would be a few times a day having it. I love Mexican food (I’m Californian so we live for it) so instead of 6 tacos I now only will have 3, and ask for one tortilla for each taco instead of the usual 2 and pair it with some charro beans for additional fiber, or just get fajitas with extra veggies and no tortillas, rice, or sour cream. Being diagnosed changed me in a positive way, and at the rate I’m going I wonder where I’m going to be when I get my next checkup in 6 months😊

I started off at 5’6 and 186 lbs. at my heaviest, which would put me in the obese BMI, just barely. I remember considering taking semaglutides at this time but my insurance wouldn’t cover it. A few months after that, I steadily began losing 1 lb a week after my doctor told me to limit my calories to 1200-1400 per day.

At my lightest I was 125 lbs. It wasn’t done in a healthy fashion; I was at the gym 2 hours a day and eating below 1200 calories. I wet to the doctor several times for malnutrition and due to feeling fatigued. I don’t think I was eating enough and my body was responding poorly.

So, a little bit of context first I'm a male in my mid 20's, 185cm/6'1 (ish), 78kg/171lbs and I used to weight 165kg/363lbs. I've been able to maintain my current weight for awhile now but I'm trying to finally finish off the job I started all those years ago.

I work a reasonably intense job 3 days a week currently, I'm on my feet all day when working and I typically average 18k steps on those days (but I'm lifting/moving stuff as well so the overall energy expendature is probably a bit higher). I have a ""floor"" step count on days where I'm not working of 10k and I always go out of my way to hit that. I checked my monthly step count and it comes out to 14k/day on average.

I'm not ""fat"" by any means, pretty much average and the job I'm moving into is sort of like face-to-face sales so obviously how presentable you are is very, very important. I wear 32"" trousers and overall I'd say I'm relatively slim/normal sized but I do have a bit more fat that I'd like which I'd like to get rid of.

I'm not entirely sure what my ""goal"" weight is but I'm guessing it would be somewhere in the 70-72kg/155-160lbs range to get genuinely lean.

My plan as far as nutrition goes is fairly simple, I'm more or less going to eat my usual diet but remove the excess stuff that I enjoy for now (for example I drink 1L of protein milk every day because it's very tasty, has lots of nutrients, 56g of protein etc but it has 550 calories which is a lot of liquid calories if you're trying to maintain a deficit).

I have three days of meals planned out that I will rotate through and the average calories across those eating days is 1,913 as well as 175g of protein.

Does this plan sound reasonable? I'm not really sure, going from obese to ""normal"" is relatively straight forward, but it seems like going from normal to lean is a totally different challenge!",,,,2025-12-06 21:00:36.87707+00,4,0,null,en,1,2025-12-06 18:45:58,7201,4,,,"[""dietary_modification""]",[],[],[],[],"[""final push to get fit"",""lost weight from 363lbs to 171lbs"",""18k steps on work days"",""14k daily step average"",""goal weight 155-160lbs"",""1L protein milk"",""1,913 calories and 175g protein""]",not_relevant,0.8,General weight loss and fitness discussion without any bariatric or PBH-related context.,patient,0.8,"[""Diet""]",neutral,,"[""determination""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""topics_dietary_modification_035""]",,1765046758,,,

I've spent the entire year getting down to this weight after I had a traumatic experience at the beginning of the year. I've tracked calories, worked out, and lost a shitton of weight.

But my belly just never went away.

Now I'm at a BMI below 21 with a BF% at around 25%. I've lost a lot of volume at my butt, but that belly just never went flat.

That's when I decided to schedule an appointment at my local obesity center to see what else could be done there...
Apparently, nothing. It's not fat. It's literally just skin. They called it an ""abdominal apron"". The only option that I've got is a (mini) tummy tuck that will run me around €3.5k at minimum.

Now I'm a college student and I'm also not exactly keen on getting surgery, but I was kinda hoping that I'd be able to wear a bikini or to be able to show some midriff next summer. Do you guys think that by increasing my butt size and by building some core muscle, I could offset this loose skin enough to make it disappear, at least a little bit?

Unfortunately, my eating habits are really unhealthy — big bags of chips, sweets, fast food, staying up late… basically everything unhealthy. I seriously want to change, but I don’t know how because these habits are so stuck with me.

Sometimes I don’t eat the whole day, and then after many hours I suddenly get hit with strong hunger and immediately go for unhealthy food — straight to a restaurant to kill the hunger with fast food. And sometimes I’m not even hungry at all, I just eat chips because I feel like it. If you ask me “are you hungry?” I’d say no. And because I stay up late, I eat out of boredom — chips, sweets, fast food — not real hunger.

I don’t know how to stay consistent with healthy eating and good habits. And with exercise, I was doing it wrong too. I never warmed up before workouts; I would jump straight into high-intensity cardio, so halfway through I’d feel pain and get tired and quit. I’d end up doing only 15 minutes. The pain during the workout made me stop. Later I learned that my approach was wrong — I should warm up and not start at high intensity.

Honestly, I feel discouraged about my weight. I’m 30 years old and 79 kg, and I’m really worried about my health.

During that process, when I caught myself ~ my middle finger on my dominant hand was injured. 

At first, I genuinely thought I had just jammed it. A week, maybe 2 later when the swelling would not go down I went to a local orthopedist who advised me that I had slightly fractured the corner of my middle knuckle &amp; had a slight year in my ligament but not to baby it anymore (I had it splinted when I went it) and it should be fine. 

I started seeing a new primary this past year, and my middle finger was one of the first things she had noticed but imo, compared to what i was used to it really wasn't *that* swollen and I played it off like ""haha yeah, must just be at that age when things don't heal right"". By this point, also, my elbow had been incredibly sore and I pretty much couldn't put any pressure or weight on my arm/lift things so this was my main focus because it was so incredibly painful. She sent me to her recommended orthopedist, and he immediately that appointment gave me a cortisol shot in my elbow which helped immensely and honestly, my elbow hasn't hurt since which is great. 

Now, I've been using my Theraputty (green/medium resistance) - I take my 15 MG of meloxicam every day at the same time - I heat my hand before my stretches, and ice it after. This last month - my finger is so bad, objectively worse than 2 years ago.

My meloxicam is not helping at all, my ortho couldnt get my appt scheduled until January 15th and advised me to go to my primary but she's also booked for now also.

 I do not have copay money to be seen at urgent care until Thursday, but I'm wondering how they would even help me? I'm a single mom, and I really cannot afford to pay them just to be told ""sorry"". There's a walk in ""urgent care"" at the orthopedic office I went to in the very beginning but I am so apprehensive to go there after my first experience. I feel like they're /why/ I'm in the position I am right now. 

Pic of middle finger in comparison with my other middle finger taken 12/3/2025 here -  https://ibb.co/7xhXqdWr

Pic this morning 12/6/2025, it's starting to bruise? I'm honestly not sure. Line is from me buddy wrapping it to my ring finger though. It won't bend well so whenever I grab anything it acts like it wants to be fancy and stays out 😅 https://ibb.co/v4hH0zKP

Pic also this morning, 12/6/2025, odd line that wasn't there before lol https://ibb.co/TBvxDbbx

At this point, I just feel lost about it all and I'm so disheartened. How can I help this? How can I advocate for myself when I go to this sketchy urgent care without them thinking I'm just some crazy lady? To be very, very, clear - it's not the pain bothering me, its the swelling.

Heey everyone,

I did something stupid in oktober I used a massage gun on my foreskin covered penis head to masturbate out of curiosity.
It felt good while using, but afterwards it felt numb and after a while it got quite stingy and sensitive until this day. I also got OCD and anxiety so I might also focus to much on it..
I'm scared to tell the doctors because I'm ambarresed about the situation.

It was a low power cheap massage gun with the fork attachment, I used it for 5 minutes on max settings I havent used it before or after the incident 

Did anyone ever got in this situation? And how did you fix it?

Two knee surgeries on my L knee (Sprained L ankle), 2012 and 2017 for removing cartilage and anchoring my knee cap to prevent dislocation. 

I sprained my L ankle pretty badly about 4-5 years ago stepping on a small pinecone. That time it was pretty bad and I resprained it during that healing process. Since then Ive resprained it about once a year from doing mundane things, like walking on my sidewalk in winter or jogging 30ft with my dog. Every time I sprain it I can walk on it almost immediately after, and while stiff and a little painful, that gows away within half a week or so.

In mid October I sprained it again by stepping out of my front door with my dogs. Just stepped on it wrong. I was able to put weight on it within about 15min and did the RICE protocol. Major pain stopped within the day,  and majority of swelling went down within 3. My ankle still has a swollen lump in front of the ankle bone (between my pinky toe and lateral malleolus), is stiff, and achy.

To try and correct this I've been making sure I'm eating fiber rich foods every day. Beans have become one of my staples, eating about 12-16 ounces just and every day, and I'm making a conserted effort to eat leafy greens as much as possible, every day is difficult due to the short shelf life.

With that I've also added psyllium husk powder, I started at 4 grams a day and have increased that to 8.

My dietary changes for weight loss have been cutting nearly all processed carbs and added sugars. Eliminating snacking, I eat two to three meals a day with no calories consumed between. I'm tracking my calorie weekly. 

On an average week day I eat 16 ounces of plain Greek yogurt, two avocados, a can of chickpeas, 5 ounces of Greens dressed in olive oil, and 8-12 ounces of chicken, tuna, or beef. I'm pretty strict during my work week.

I don't know for sure what happens, it doesn't matter if I'm eating crickets, spicy salady from a street cart, pasta from a fancy Italian restaurant, a or McDonalds. My stool is a mess - I get anything but a solid piece. I also get the ""urgent"" thing where out of the blue I really have to go number 2.

The first guess of course is that something in my system is wrong. But in EVERY international trip, as soon as I land in another country, my stools go back to solid and stay like that. Perfect, solid, one piece, and once a day. I traveled to South America, Europe, Japan...in all these places my stools go back to normal immediately upon arrival.

I though it could be the water, but even drinking only high end mineral bottled water (Mont Fleur) it doesn't help.

Due to the nature of my work (I have imporant meetings daily), I can't really be running to the toilet at any time, so I take Imodium (Loperamide) and that ""plugs"" me for the day. Next day the effect wears out and I'm back to ""anything but solid"".

For anyone who’s been on crutches: What everyday tasks caught you completely off guard? I’m doing some research on the real-world challenges of using crutches, and I’d love to hear about your experience:

• What seemingly simple tasks became way harder than you expected? (Things you never would have thought about until you were actually on crutches)

• Were there moments where you thought “there HAS to be a better way to do this”? What were they?

• Did you find any products, hacks, or workarounds that actually helped? What worked and what didn’t?

• Looking back, what would have made your recovery period significantly easier or more independent?

My dad has been on deaths door perpetually for 10 years. He’s a severe alcoholic and has caused himself two strokes, liver cirrhosis, over 50 cases of pancreatitis, and a plethora of broken bones and snapped tendons from malnutrition and toxicity related to the cirrhosis. Most recently he fractured his femur while walking. 

Over Thanksgiving he ODd on Tylenol and ended up admitted for uncontrolled diabetes (three days on insulin drip and intervention to get it below 500) and a significantly high A1C (over 9%) and a heart rate from 70s to 190s randomly while resting (they blame withdrawal currently) as well as pancreatitis.

Pancreatitis didn’t go away after 13 days on an all ice chip diet so they did repeat scans and found the swelling had been hiding a mass. They’ve since called in oncologists and deemed it 99% cancer (technically they can’t say 100% until a removal surgery and it’s sent to pathology for staging). 

Their current plan is to put a port in, do chemo, rescan and plan for a surgery, then chemo after but they haven’t fully committed and said they may just jump to the surgery if his pancreas can decrease a little more in size on its own. He keeps calling me to tell me he’s being released today everyday and did again today so I don’t actually know how long until his release, I’ve only been able to visit outside of hours to speak with the doctor. 

My questions are:

How ‘bad’ will chemo be? He’ll be living in my house so I want to prepare mentally. He’s already very sick so I’ve seen sick but I’ve also heard there’s nothing as hard as chemo so any concept of what to expect day to day would be nice. 

How do I prepare my house? If he stays I’m thinking a mini fridge stocked with water bottles and ice in his room, a trash can and a lot of extra trash bags, a lot of gloves and sanitizing wipes. I’ve heard his bathroom needs to be ‘his’ during this time due to radiation? so making our roommate share my bathroom instead of with him. 

Should I plan to have him stay here or get him and his girlfriend (caretaker now) a private apartment until treatment ends? I’ll prepare either space with the advice from the above question. 

Reasons he maybe shouldn’t stay with me is it’s a five person household and I can’t control exposure to sickness I work at a homeless shelter a few days a week and my roommate with a blue collar population both of which tend to expose us often to sickness. Also I have 3 cats and my dads allergic, and although it’s not so bad right now he’s dying, it is bad enough he’s sniffly and sneezy and I know his immune system will be compromised. Also I have a tub shower not a walk in and he already has a fractured femur I know chemo makes people weaker. My husband has offered to get a short term apartment that has accommodations and ability to quarantine but I don’t want to isolate my dad if it’s not necessary. 

Is this all worth it? I guess this is more for me. My dad’s always been sick but the kind of guy who thinks he isn’t. I blame the alcohol dementia. 

He’s terrified of dying but also I don’t think he’s the kind who would find out he has 6 months to live and would change his lifestyle to elongate it. If anything he’d take out an enormous amount of debt to die with and go out partying three months in from a cocaine induced heart attack. 

He’s already sick. There’s no reversing the damage he’s already done. He will NOT eat fruits or vegetables or anything but red meat and bread and cheese. He will NOT take his insulin, he will NOT avoid substances. He always says he will but he doesn’t. He’s morbidly obese, and the only reason he isn’t losing it in the hospital over lack of alcohol is the access to pain medication.

At this rate and with how aggressive pancreatic cancer is, is this all going to actually buy him time? I’ve read that there’s a high likelihood it has metastasized if it’s causing symptoms and his is. What does that even look like? 

Everything online about pancreatic cancer says ‘less than 12% after 5 years’ but isn’t that off everyone who gets it? Aren’t they all theoretically healthier than him, or willing to do the ‘right’ thing and elongate their chances? Does that include those who it metastasized and those metastasis are what cause the death? 

I so incredibly doubt he’s making it 5 years seeing him today. I doubt he’s making it one. But I’ve said that before and he’s still here. And I do want him to - my husband and I are trying for kids (well were we paused during this chaos) and I’d love for him to at least meet them even if I recognize they’ll never remember him. 

I don’t know if that makes sense but any advice is appreciated.

Hello all,

I kind of need some general advice. My mother turned 60 this September. In her late 50s her health issues started becoming more apparent. She has hypertension (she takes medications—her side of the family has a VERY prominent history of high blood pressure and strokes. All the women die of a stroke in their early 80s). But she gets these very intense dizzy spells? A while ago she actually went to the hospital because they thought she was having a stroke or something. They’ve done CT scans, EKGs, and there’s nothing wrong with her heart or her brain apparently. They said she has vertigo.

She’s convinced she has POTS although I’m not really sure why. She passes out in the heat. The dizzy spells apparently come on randomly which is concerning. I’ve mentioned that maybe it has something to do with her blood pressure medications?

She has very poor habits that frankly aren’t going to change at this point, unfortunately, despite my protests. Her living situation is…stressful. She has very bad insomnia. She doesn’t drink or smoke, but she doesn’t eat well or very much. And worst of all, she is a workaholic. She is a social worker in very low income areas with very stressful and traumatic abuse cases. The stress and lack of sleep alone kill you faster than anything else.

Is this just something that happens when you get older? Is this a precursor to something else more serious, especially with her history of blood pressure issues? I just don’t know if this is something she’s just living with now or this is a serious sign that something might occur. Her doctors just kind of scratch their heads and say “you have vertigo, here are some pills.”

Thank you!

Sex: Male
Medications: None currently
Duration of symptoms: ~9-10weeks
Existing medical issues: None 

Hi, I’ve been dealing with some persistent but confusing symptoms for about 10 weeks and would appreciate your input. (Pic link at the bottom)

First symptom: (18 days after exposure - receptive oral sex) 
Located on dorsal side of the penis, was not painful.
It looked like a scab that fell off the same day and revealed a plaque/ulcer like change (4-5mm) which lasted for around 6 weeks and healed with pink scar.


Other symptoms: (33-34 days after exposure)
Pain in cervical lymph nodes, A faint rash on chest and abdomen, Burning tongue feeling

My first thought was: Definitely Syphilis. 
So I tested at 36 days with treponemal EIA which was negative, and then went on Doxycycline: 2x daily for 14 days 100mg.  
4 days into Doxy all symptoms dissapeared, but all came back 2 weeks after the last dose.

I retested at 10 and 12 weeks with TPHA and TP ECLIA. Both came out negative.

At 12 weeks additional tests were done and are all negative: HIV 4th gen,HBsAg,HCV Ab,NG/CT/Ureaplasma,Micoplasma

Additionaly, my complete CBC with Liver, Kidney, Thyroid, Iron,  glucose and other markers is normal.

Summary of symptoms:

Main symptoms now:
Mild, diffuse, non-itchy red rash on chest/torso that comes and goes throughout the day 
There is no scaling, no bumps.

Rash  resolved while taking doxycycline for 2 weeks, but returned ~2 weeks after stopping


Lymph nodes:

Two lymph nodes under the jaw intermittently swell with pain and are often normal in the morning


Mouth/tongue:

Occasional burning of the tongue and palate, even though I don't see any mucosal changes
 

Other symptoms:

No fever, no night sweats, no fatigue, no weight loss, no sore throat, no other systemic symptoms


Do I need to retest, or look into other possibilities?

I went to an ortho walk-in, who diagnosed and said I just have to wait this out and rest it as much as possible. Heat and ice. Follow up in another week. 

Meanwhile, I'm worried about developing frozen shoulder due to not moving. I can't/won't lift my arm fully from the side, going into a T position, and then fully up. I suppose I could force myself, but it's agony. I can lift up to the front, fully. It's easier to finger-walk my way up a wall until my hand is fully over my head and then rotate my torso so I'm fully rotating my shoulder. 

Is doing this - assists and without just straight using my muscles- sufficient to fully move my joint to avoid it freezing? Or do I have to actually engage my muscles? I'm only doing it twice a day.

I am a 21 year old male with no family history of ALS. 10 months ago, I noticed some twitching in my hand. Pretty quickly, the twitching was in my arms, legs, back, neck, chest, etc. quickly found out that fasciculations are an early sign of ALS or can simply be benign fasciculations syndrome (BFS). Within the first 4 months of twitching, I had 2 clean clinical exams. At month 5, I had a clean clinical exam from a Neuro and EMGs done in 10+ muscles spanning my right arm and leg. At month 7 1/2, after believing that I was having tongue fasciculations, I went back for another EMG. Neuro did another evaluation, saw no tongue fasciculations and exam was clean again, did the EMG in the same muscles in my arm and leg and also in my tongue. All clean again. At month 9, I had my aunt (a family medicine doctor) check my hands and arms for any signs of atrophy and she found none. The internet is full of so much conflicting information about when ALS can be functionally ruled out and I can put this chapter of my life behind me. My Neuro couldn’t give me much more information beyond “your EMGs are clean. You don’t have ALS.” When will my chances of my twitching being due to ALS be as near to 0 as is medically possible?
Thank you.

Hey docs, so this issue started around 5 months ago when I had trouble sleeping because my heart started racing and then whenever I used to wake up, I felt uneasy as if I was unable to breathe. Finally when I let out the gas via burping I felt better. Looked it up a bit and found out it's called Roemheld syndrome. Anyway I went to a gastroenterologist and he suggested endoscopy and some other tests like ultrasound, ECG etc. Ultrasound and ECG reports came out to be normal, endoscopy was also normal with no ulcers/hernia but with mild GERD and an active H. Pylori infection. The other problem was that I used to burp a lot throughout the day and the constant burping caused a slight pain in my back. I  was on a triple antibiotics course + PPI for 14 days and as expected it caused my stool to become a bit soft. Before the endoscopy and H.Pylori detection I took Gaviscon/InstaRaft for about 2 weeks as well. I was hoping my burping to completely stop after the course but it didn't :(
I went to the doctor again and he prescribed me 1 month of pre and probiotics( to restore the effects of antibiotics) along with Fexuclue 40. I took these and also  I got retested and the H Pylori is negative now though but the burping situation and back pain hasn't completely stopped. 
 This is really annoying and frustrating to live with and honesty hoping to get some relief from this once and for all.
I do have some mild anxiety issues too and that seems to be aggravating this( it's kind of a vicious cycle) but don't think that's the root cause.
Btw, my stool is completely fine and I don't have constipation, heartburn or any stomach pain. It's just the constant gas and burping and the associated uneasiness l/palpitations causing sleep issues is what I am struggling with.

There’s the link for the pics⬆️

I (22F) started experiencing itchiness yesterday and today it’s developing into a rash. I got a haircut yesterday, and I’m thinking it could maybe be from the cloak if it was used on someone before me who had their hair dyed or had some kind of chemical treatment? Maybe just from the detergent? Although the rash does seem a little high for that to be the case. 

I use a cleanser, toner, tretinoin, and face lotion every night and cleanser, toner, sunscreen in the am and did yesterday too. I’ve been on tret for 8 months so I don’t think it’s that, but I did tone my face like 5 times yesterday and then put lotion on too bc of the itchiness. 

Sometimes I get what I think is contact dermatitis from using products that are too abrasive for my skin or using them too frequently. Is that what this is? I put hydrocortisone cream and it helped a little. Can I put makeup on over this? Should I stop using tret till this goes away? Should I tell the salon even tho I’m not sure the cloak caused it? I have kinda crappy skin in general, it’s actually seemingly gotten worse since I’ve been on tret, more frequent breakouts, I also pick at my skin kinda compulsively. I’ve had a rash like this before and I never rly know what causes it.

I am baffled and cant think of a single thing that caused this. My laundry detergent is the same and hypoallergenic, im not allergic to anything I know of. They do not itch and turn white briefly when pressing down on them before slowly turning red again. 

Took antibiotic regimine starting November 19th and long finished it (amoxicillin and azithromycin). So I dont think theres a correlation.

It's intermittent but happens multiple times in a month. I drink a normal amount of liquid and halfway down, it gets stuck. The peristalsis in my esophagus seems to just stop and the liquid is stuck halfway down. I have to swallow ""dry"" 5-10 times to get the swallowibg peristalsis to start again. If I try to drink more liquid to force it down (like my fiance says other people do), it just adds to whatever is stuck in there. I've actually choked myself with the liquid if I try to force it down with more volume.

This has been happening occasionally for my entire adult life but the frequency is increasing, in addition to it taking more effort to get the liquid to go down. Lately, it's at least a couple time a week. It kinda scares me because it feels like I'm having a harder and harder time swallowing.

 I'm asking because if it's a removal thing it would save me a ton of money to get that done before Jan 1. (Of course no idea if can be scheduled etc but if i need it removed I want to at least ask if we can move quickly)

It didn't make me drowsy at all it actually did the opposite. It was awful. Somehow I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up today I felt completely fever free.

As for my injury I got an injury while playing football(soccer). I got the injury at the beginning of the game and im sure it was by stepping really hard on the ground to pivot and then immense pain started in the heel of my foot towards the inside and it feels deeper than usual(like it isnt on the surface of my foot), i kept playing the whole game as there were no substitutes for my position. I told my coach about it and i rested for a week and it felt fine until i went back and same thing happened. I kept playing for 2 more weeks bc the injury would only spike back up if i did a somewhat hard landing on my heel again which happened in todays game. I did a bit of research on chat gpt and apparently it might be a heel contusion. I cant tell if its the bone hurting or not because the pain feels a bit deep. To specify where it is, it is on my right heel towards the inside of my foot on the side.

I always classified as “obese” at almost every year in life  that I can remember. Getting scolded by doctors that I was too heavy for my age, early menstruation at age 8, started Birth control at age 11 for irregular periods/ hormones, PCOS, diabetes high cholesterol, diabetes, the whole metabolic syndrome package. 

Hispanic heritage and traditions, and now after therapy ( still in therapy) some various traumas led to food as comfort, of course can’t blame everything on trauma and environment, but food was my vice. 
So at 5’1 and 365lbs at age 19 I was the youngest in my area (SoCal) to qualify for the RNY gastric bypass at this time . Had a whole team of surgeons, consent to video, medical students, literally a medical academic show. 

I was not a smooth recovery, strictures, ulcers, gallstones, gallbladder removal (2013), I lost weight VERY quickly and was a frequent flyer at that hospital for electrolyte imbalance ( mainly potassium), and malnutrition issues. In 9 months I had lost 110 ish pounds 
Finally after 2014 my body got used to the new digestive set up and dumping syndrome. I think my lowest weight was 160

Went to college, went to nursing school 2017- stress and eating filler food had me gaining again. Mind you my stomach never stretched and I dumped at every sugary/greasy meal. Yet somehow still went all the way back to 240 in 2023 ( does a break up of a 5 year relationship contribute too? Maybe?). 

Forgot the whole purpose of RNY was a “tool”,  and tried to do low carb started losing weight slowly. Current situation dysfunction of oddi! Because of my anatomy that little sphincter in the Biliary tree is acting up and I’ve been having. Gallbladder phantom pain for the last year. Like the pain that radiates to shoulder and you’re immobile.  

Had to find an experienced endoscopist (took a whole year) that is comfy doing an ERCP with gastric bypass anatomy. Had some thing called the EGDE Procedure  with stent placement ( part 1) 11/10 going to have part 2 12/10 to cut that sphincter and take out the stent. If I can attach a pic of the procedure I will.

Just wanted to see if there are any other long timers on here who have long term issues after 10+years post op 


TL;DR

Got the surgery at 19 now 33  and 12 years later post op complications, not many GI can handle RNY anatomy. Finding community too, trying to be social ty

32526,reddit.com,t3_1pftder,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1pftder/out_of_options/,Out of options,"Ya'll, I wrote this in response to someone else's post on: How did you know you were ready for gastric bypass surgery? I ended up writing more than I intended but I wanted to post separately in case others out there need to hear this: 

I'm hoping to get the surgery in May 2026.

Here's what has led me to this point: in 2017, I had lost over 100 lbs and had the tummy tuck to cut away a very large and droopy apron of fat that had just been hanging after the weight loss (like, seriously, I looked better when I was fat because it at least filled the apron).  After that was cut away, I loved the way my stomach looked and maintained (almost my goal weight) around three years. My goal was 150. I was at 170. But I felt amazing, I could go to any store and just about know that they have something there for me that would fit and look amazing. I had so much energy, and I had a healthy relationship with food and exercise. 

I had been working as a college instructor (several adjunct/ part-time positions at a time) and decided to take a full-time job teaching high school around 2021. That's when literally everything went to shit. Teaching consumed my entire life. Since students ate in our classroom (due to the pandemic) and planning period was replaced by enrichment (also due to the pandemic), the only time I had to plan was weekends and evenings. I was living in survival mode. 

Most of the time, I forgot to eat until I was on my way home because I had no downtime at work, so I would stop and get Sonic or whatever was convenient. I would buy dinner for my family but I would eat a small burger and a pretzel stick otw home and then eat again with them (so I was buying like a pre meal to account for my skipped lunch and another meal). Then, I would graze in the kitchen for a while before bed. I basically went all day without food and then binged when I got home.  

The stress and burnout from the job was ruining my life. I thought things couldn't be worse until I went to the doctor for intense face pain I'd recently developed, and she told me I had a condition called Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), which is incurable but could be relieved with medications and surgery. Eventually, I was up to almost 3000 gabapentin and 900 Oxcarbazapine per day. These meds cause drowsiness and can increase hunger. Add that to the work stress, I had went from 170-220 in a span of 2 years. 

Then, in 2023, I had my first brain surgery, which caused me to put on another 30 lbs, but once I got back to work, all of the 30 lbs went away. When that surgery failed, I had a second brain surgery 6 months later and put on exactly 30 lbs again. 

I left that job for a MUCH more stable and calm position, but the weight did not come off like it did after the first surgery. I stayed at 250 despite having a nutritionist for over a year and trying to stay consistent with gym visits. I struggle with having energy because some days (particularly very cold days), my face feels like I'm being electrocuted, so I have to increase meds to cope. The second surgery helped a lot, but evidently not from the cold. However, in the summer, I can just about come off the meds completely!

Additionally, over the last year, I developed firbroids that had been growing inside of my uterus, causing it to grow 400× the normal size of a uterus, so I began experiencing intense fibroid pain and bleeding that interfered with everything in my life. I avoided any type of plans the last two weeks out of a month because I would have random 10/10 pain that required me to sit on a heating pad until it passed (usually 10-20 min). Because of that, I'm about to have a total hysterectomy, and honestly, it can't come soon enough! I've been counting down the days. I'm getting it later this month (thank God!). 

So, for a year now, I've been juggling my life around not one, but two very different, very severe pain conditions. 

Given my history of weight gain after surgery, I'm worried about this going in. Currently, I'm at 260. I know losing weight becomes more difficult after a hysterectomy. And then there's this: I've dealt with high blood pressure since I was in my 20s (I'm now 41), and I've recently been placed in the pre-diabetic range. I'm tired all the time, my feet hurt more often than not, and I often feel zaps in my feet (kind of like the TN pain in my face) in bed at night that make it hard to sleep. In looking into this, I've found out that is a symptom of diabetes. 

As of now, I'm mostly considered still healthy, but I know if things don't change, it will get much worse. I have been through so much pain already. Much more than most people will ever experience. I dont say that to brag. TN is known as the ""suicide disease"" because people will hurt so bad they accidentally overdose on the meds used to manage the pain. I believe that because I have been rushed to the ER more than a few times when the pain reaches a point to where you just want to end it. Not because you want to die or you're depressed, but because you just want the pain to end and you can't think of anything else. 

I know that gastric bypass surgery or weight loss doesn't necessarily cure that, but it will drastically decrease the amount of inflammation in my body caused by food, which (I believe and hope) will decrease the amount of pain. I'm doing this so I can have more pain-free days. I'm doing it so I can get out of the pre-diabetic range. So I can stand on my feet without experiencing so much pain. So I can have more energy again to do the things I enjoy with my family without always feeling like I'm sacrificing comfort. I'm doing it so I can hopefully lower my blood pressure. So I can enjoy my life again. So I can live longer. So I can fit in real clothes again instead of always settling for leggings and a t-shirt dress or stretchy pants. I know there are risks involved, but I think I'm at a good window of space in time where I can still turn some things around, and in my case, the benefits outweigh the risks. 

So I'm at a point where I'm asking, ""What could go wrong if I don't get this surgery,"" instead of the other way around.

1. cutting out your phone 30 mins before bed 
reduces late night stress/anxiety makes sleep deeper and stronger which means less hungry, less likely to crave food , just solid all around

2. morning sunlight when you wake up . for 10 mins circadian alignment, again helps with sleep, insulin.

So he’d walk around with this pole as it fed into his right abdomen. 

I’m trying to remember—would that be his insulin then? He would also go in for dialysis twice a week. I would help warm his pouch up and then there was something else I’d help him with at his injection site, but I remember being grossed out and still doing it. I’m guessing that was his pump?

I am going to the er tomorrow but I want some outside opinions.

12 weeks ago I was in a serious bicycle accident where I broke my elbow, my proximal humerus, and suffered a concussion, loss of consciousness, and damage to my face from my protective goggles. I was wearing a helmet.

The arm got the immediate attention followed by the concussion care. But my eye socket never fully healed. The bone just under my eye was swollen, not as bad as the initial injury, but I was thinking that was just my face now. None of my doctors gave it any thought.

A week ago I woke up with new swelling on the inside part of my eye, a new bump in rhe parotid area, and itchy that has made my whole cheek red and inflamed. No fever but I have had general malaise. I went to the urgent care on Tuesday, cleared for a strep infection (my daughter was exposed and at the time I thought maybe that’s what this is). He said I have cellulitis around my eye, gave me an antibiotic and a topical steroid creme that is not helping.

Today my husband says call your regular doctor and get an appointment and if it goes away you can always cancel. My dispo paperwork says if no improvement within 3 days to seek more help. So I call my family Dr and they were somewhat surprised that I think it’s from the accident. But I mean other alternatives would be a lupus butterfly rash. I’ve never been suspected of having lupus. So the injury from my accident seems more likely.

So my dumb @$$ asks chat and that really alarmed me so now o don’t know if I’m being TOO cautious or not. But my husband and I agree if it’s not better tomorrow I’m going to the er.

I was sick with something (covid or the flu) 6 months ago and ever since, airpods/earbuds/ear plugs feel like they don't fit/seal right in my right ear. I know it's not the airpods themselves because I've tried multiple pairs and even bought other wireless earbuds from other brands like Bose and Sony and I have this issue with all of them.

My ear feels fine otherwise until I put the airpod in it, then it feels like there's pressure and it feels like outside noises bleed through. This is a big deal for me because I use airpods for sensory-related issues and need them to function.

An ENT couldn't find anything wrong with my ear except I tested positive for a dust mite allergy, so I'm starting shots soon.

I've tried nasal sprays like flonase, azelastine, etc. none help. This has persisted for 6 months now but current situations require me to use my airpods significantly more. I might lose my job without them.

I also saw an audiologist, and one thing that stuck out to me during the tymp test was that everytime I blinked (I blink pretty hard as a nervous tic) the machine spiked. When I pointed out the machine was only spiking when I blinked she said she'd ignore those results and instead said I passed the test. I'm wondering if she shouldn't have done that. When I blink hard I also feel muscles in my ear activate and I hear a light wooshing sound, but I've experienced that my whole life.

I am 32M, 156lb, no current medications, 1 drink maybe once a week.

About 6 weeks ago I saw a podiatrist for an ingrown toenail on my big toe. Everything went well and healing was going well.  He set me up for follow ups and mentioned that we would take larger gaps between follow ups and trim the nail down at each follow up to ""train the nail to grow back properly"".  At the first follow up he trimmed it down slightly and also cut the other side of the nail back as well for some reason.  Fast forward to my 4 week follow up and he trims the previously ingrown side slightly and then again cuts the other side very far down to where it started bleeding.  Both times I had mentioned to them that that side was not being a problem, but 2 days after this appointment the skin next to the nail seems to have swollen up into a granuloma, so now the other side of my toe is a problem as well.  

  
Problem Background: The toe problem started back in march where I either injured or got an infection of the lining of the nail in question that stopped the nail from growing for a few months.  It started to grow back under the new one and was pushing the old nail out.  I had it looked at and no issues at the time.  By the time the ingrown nail started it was about 50:50 new nail and old.  During the ingrown treatment the podiatrist also used a motorized filer (looked like a Dremel) to make the dead part of the nail thinner so it was easier for the new nail to push out.

My question to the experts is: Is it normal to cut back both sides of a nail even if only one side is ingrown? At the time the podiatrist cut that side, it was already past the skin so not sure how it would become ingrown down the line. The podiatrist said something about it making sure it grew back right, but did not articulate to me that he saw any problems on that side that I may not have seen.

I’ve seen 5 doctors and 2 specialists throughout these years. Have been on different types of the pill and Nuva Ring. Still happens. 

Have had multiple Pap smears-all normal. Even made them test me for STD’s-negative. Had a cryosurgery for a cervical ectropion they found-still happening. Had a D&amp;C and they found fragments of polyps and had those removed-still happening. Multiple transvaginal ultrasounds-still happens. Doctors have expressed they don’t think it’s endometriosis or adenmyosis. I now have the Mirena IUD for 9 months now-still happens. And they prescribed an estrogen birth control pill now. 
Not to mention I have to miss work for these appointments and pay for a lot of these procedures that are hundreds of dollars.

I am getting very depressed trying to figure out what is wrong with me. To start, I will say that I have a painful annular tear on L4. I had physical therapy over the summer for 8 weeks, then the MRI. Showed degeneration in l4 and l5 and the tear. It's a small tear, but it was leaving me screaming in pain for a quick second throughout the day. I saw an orthopedic doctor on September 18th to go over my MRI. He told me to stop working out for now, gave me a steroid shot, and told me to come back in 3 months. (I had been on a muscle relaxer for a couple of months at that point, and he told me to continue.) A couple of weeks later, it felt like my legs were getting weak, and my stabbing back pain was getting worse. I'll start listing the symptoms now:

-Oct. 12, both legs gave out, and I fell for the first time.
-Legs got progressively weaker and weaker, falling more
-Stabbing level 9 pain happening all throughout the day now
-Oct. 22, I got freaked out and saw a spine specialist, she said my back issues wouldn't cause both legs to be weak. She gave me a different muscle relaxer, celebrex and a 6 day steroid pack
- Not long after that appointment, it felt like my arms were maybe getting weak, but I was in so much pain with my back that I tried to ignore it
-About a week, after maybe a little more, my arm weakness was just as bad as my leg weakness, and my hand started having a tremor
- By November 7th I was wobbling everywhere, I could no longer stand normally. I was now not only falling from my legs giving out, I was falling head first because of the wobble.
-Blood pressure was the highest it had ever been
- I was screaming out all the time in pain; it was very embarrassing

November 8th I went to the ER because I was so scared.
I was there for 3 days.
I told them all this information, in addition to a few other problems that I thought may be connected
- Unable to fully empty bladder since Oct 2024
-new heat intolerance
-periods only last 1-2 days now
- I have trouble talking now, its slow and sometimes slurred, my cognition has declined as well, probably from not sleeping well

I thought heck, maybe I have MS.

Brain MRI was clear, spine MRI showed no change since the September one
No lupus ( mom has it)
No myathenia gravis ( sister has that)
No lyme disease
All the bloodwork they did looks fine, except it's showing I am inflamed.

One doctor in the hospital saw that I have bipolar disorder, then said it may be psychosomatic. I have never had issues like this before. I take pride in being healthy and I'm a go-go-go type of person. Why all of a sudden would I be imagining this? He said my bladder issue is separate and is normal for a woman who has given birth. I am only 37 and gave birth 10 years ago. They said my back pain is much worse because my muscles are weak. They did see that when they pushed against my muscles, they would start to tremble like crazy. I was overall walking a little better and in less pain when in the hospital, because I hadn't moved in 3 days. The more I try to do, the worse I get.

I am feeling better now, but I am still very much not normal. My arms are exhausted just typing this. I still have to use the walker sometimes. I pretty much still have all the problems, just not as bad as in November. I had a follow up appiontment with a neurologist that told me my results were all negative and refused to treat me further. He wanted to put me on medicine for hand tremor. I said my hand is shaking because of extreme weakness. He said he is not treating that and he doesnt need to see me again. I am at a loss!!! What on earth could be wrong with me? I have bipolar disorder and recently found out that I have Hashimotos disease, but other than those, im healthy! I cannot keep living like this. I am massively depressed and hardly sleeping.

My issue has persisted for approximately 6 months. 

I've been dealing with a sensitive issue for
approximately 6 months now. When I eiaculate I have immediate pain that pulses like a lightning pulse, coinciding with the waves of orgasm. The pain is at the left groin area, just left and above the penis. It feels like it is fairly shallow below the skin or not very deep..

I was already seeing a urologist, initially for low testosterone, and I was injecting testosterone for a few months, but stopped doing so earlier this year. My testosterone levels actually seem to be better on my own since stopping the injections. When I brought my current issue to their attention, they immediately said it sounded like prostatitis. They did no scans or tests of any kind. Instead, prescribed an antibiotic to take for 28 davs, because in their words, it's hard
for the medicine to get down into the prostate

I''ve been through 3 or 4, (honestly can't remember) rounds of antibiotics, with 3 different antibiotics, and it is not solving the problem. I'm very frustrated, as you can imagine, so l'm turning to reddit lol.

I do have a right inquinal hernia that doesn't require immediate surgery.  One of my questions is.. is it possible for a hernia to affect this? Like, if I have a
left inguinal hernia as well, that I may not be aware of.  I'm looking for any
advice or suggestions, as I'm set to go back for a follow up, and I don't want them to iust give me another month of antibiotics, because I really don't
think that is good for my body either.

The pain almost feels like something is clogged in the semen pipeline, for lack of better words. Please

Context: 35F, no known health conditions, currently no medication/supplements. In 2019 I stopped taking Spironolactone and BC after being acne-free for nearly a decade. A few months later I noticed whifs of a foul, cumin-like odor coming from my neck (nowhere else). My partner also noticed the smell. There was no obvious trigger, never had BO problems previously. Derm suggested I take Spironolactone again, which helped at first but the problem returned. Over the years the smell became stronger &amp; constant. My skin also produces more sebum (my face and hair always feel oily, acne is back). And while the smell is predominantly from my neck, I also notice it on my chest sometimes. It’s not my BO smell (which is different and not as strong/offensive).

There are no obvious triggers. Stress and alcohol make it worse, but it’s always there. No itching or visible markings. But some odd changes: my face and neck feel hot after mild activity (heart also racing), and I randomly get red splotches on my neck that go away within the hour. Possibly unrelated, but my libido has significantly declined and my periods are now irregular. I often have trouble sleeping (exhausted by 8 pm; wake up around 3 am).

I wash my face 2x per day; shower nightly. Not overweight. Reasonably healthy exercise routine and diet. No anxiety disorders.

I’ve seen several dermatologists. Woods lamp exam indicated bacteria (coral-colored dots); skin sample showed only “skin flora.”

The following treatments had no impact:
- Cutting coffee and alcohol
- No make up, perfume or tight clothing
- Nightly vinegar soak
- Witch Hazel applied morning/night
- Zinc diaper cream
- Antibacterial soap nightly in shower
- Lume body wash nightly in shower
- Sulphuric face wash nightly in shower (prescription)
- Clindamyacin (prescription)

Any idea what this is? Why is it only on my neck? What can I try to treat it?

It doesn’t seem to be contagious (my partner is fine). But it’s hurt my confidence and desire to be intimate. I also hesitate to hug loved ones or hold my friends babies for fear of infecting them.

For several months I’ve had constant tenderness or pain when touching my lower right abdomen, and occasionally other areas as well. I also have occasional pain or uneasiness after eating and sometimes constipation but not constantly.

I had a colonoscopy two years ago which the report said revealed no actual polyps (just “lymphoid polyps”), and a month ago I had an abdominal ultrasound where they saw nothing unusual but it was sometimes obscured by “dense bowel gas,” and the appendix was marked “not seen.”

I would write it off as gas pain but I don’t know why it mostly only presents itself as tenderness in that one spot. And I feel like if it were the appendix there would be other signs or worsening symptoms after this long.

I’ve considered going to emergency but I don’t know what they could find that the ultrasound didn’t. I thought I would post here in case these symptoms sound familiar to anyone.

One question I would ask is: is it worth getting my appendix checked even if the symptoms don’t match appendicitis? And related to that, how could I get it checked if the ultrasound couldn’t pick it up?

A few times over the past several months, I would get these strange episodes as I'm falling asleep. Right as I feel like I drift off, I jolt awake and have this feeling like I'm having a panic attack, and my whole body jerks for a second or two. The movements can be intesne, so much so that one time I kicked something off the table next to me. Sometimes when it happens I would have this feeling like I'm falling through the sky. I feel like I have no control over my body when this happens.

I have been seeing a neurologist for several other symptoms that began a few months ago when I began tapering the Ativan – parasthesias, olfactory hallucinations, and migraines. I think I made a couple older posts on here explaining this. Neurologist did a MRI w/ and w/o contrast and 24 hour EEG, which did not show anything wrong. At the time I was worried the olfactory hallucinations were focal seizures, but now have reason to believe these might be psychogenic (though still not completely sure).

The panic attacks, however, have been much more sporadic and have been going on a lot longer than everything else. It's just weird to me that I only get these when I'm falling asleep. I know this is very out there, but I'm concerned that these are some kind of frontal lobe seizures. I have no idea if this is related to the other symptoms. Does this sound dangerous, or like something I should make a follow-up with the neurologist for?

The nosebleeds subsided within a month or two. Picture 6 and 7 are of those nosebleeds. 


 On November 9th 2025, I somehow messed with the mass too much scratching my dried up nose and I guess... perforated it? The scab never lasts longer than a 1-3 days, it never dries up properly and it starts bleeding and oozing fluid (similar to the fluid inside my cystic acne, clear, sticky, dries out yellow) for hours on end.

The fluid hasn't changed consistency or colour, my nose doesn't feel warm or red and there's no concerning sign of infection that I can see. Should I just... keep doing what I'm doing?

My son has really severe ADHD and secondary anxiety. He’s been medicated for the ADHD since kindergarten. Started with Guanfancine and moved onto stimulants.

It didn’t improve and then he began a form of self harm in second grade (he picked all the skin off his fingers around his nails. Constantly.) we sought further intervention through the psychiatrist and he started on sertraline. It has helped so much but he still struggles. He has scars from picking himself when he’s anxious. So this is a genuine problem. He’s on 125mg and has been for 2 years. We added in .50mg Risperidone (about 8 months ago) when he made it clear he was struggling with his anxiety.

Chiari malformation?","Finally fixed my insurance and I am reviewing my scans so I know I have everything to bring back to my specialists as my symptoms have gotten worse the last year. 

In 2022 I had an MRI because I was having issues with my hands seizing up and tremors, notably one in my head that periodically causes my head to shake back and forth, almost like it's vibrating. You can only see it if you stare closely. My neurologist hinted around maybe it was carpal tunnel, but due to my tremors he ordered the MRI and bloodwork. As soon as my blood work came back with a +ANA he sent me to rheumatology and I never saw him again. He never actually gave me a report on my MRI. I don't see him until January at the earliest.

Here is a copy paste of my report, I'll try to include a picture in the comments as well to include the full report.

__________

CLINICAL HISTORY: Tremor, unspecified 16 ml of Gadavist 
 
PROCEDURE: MRI Brain w/ and w/o Contrast 
 
COMPARISON: No comparison 
 
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MRI of the brain without and with intravenous
administration of 16 cc Gadavist contrast agent. 
 
FINDINGS: Study is degraded by artifact from patient motion. There are a few punctate
nonspecific foci of T2 hyperintense signal within the periventricular white matter.
Findings are nonspecific but unlikely to be related to chronic microangiopathic disease
and a patient of this age. Findings may be due to sequela of infectious/inflammatory
processes, migraine headaches, remote trauma, and unlikely from chronic
demyelination or vasculitis. The ventricles and other CSF spaces are appropriate.
Diffusion imaging shows no evidence of acute infarction or other acute abnormality.
There is no evidence of intracranial blood products. There is no abnormal intra or
extra-axial post contrast enhancement. There is a developmental venous anomaly of the
left frontal lobe.. There is no evidence of osseus lesions. Prominence of the posterior
nasopharyngeal soft tissue. Recommend further evaluation with direct visualization.
Polyp versus retention cyst of the right maxillary sinus. 2 mm inferior tonsillar ectopia.

__________

My question is the 2mm inferior tonsillar ectopia contributing to my symptoms? It's progressively gotten worse. Specifically my dystonia has now spread to my neck and face. My muscles will spasm and contract and it's especially bad at night. Stress/adrenaline makes it worse. I've had to pull over. It's mostly been located on my right side. It will be my neck, face, down my shoulder and arms. My side and down my legs to my feet. The longest it's lasted recently was 10 minutes. I was laying down on my left side. I went to move and my face drooped and my neck contracted. My husband thought I was having a stroke. 

This was something that progressed after having covid in 2021. I was hospitalized and it took me about 8 months to recover. I've never been able to fully go back to work full time without issues.

Now two days later I’m in such extreme pain I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can barely drink, and only warm liquids like tea because the cold makes it worse. I can’t open my mouth wide enough to get a spoon in anyway, because that makes the pain sooo much worse I can’t handle it.

I don’t have insurance so going to the doctor is off the table unless it’s a critical emergency.

Is there any over the counter medication that would help? I’ve tried Tylenol, ibuprofen, even NyQuil and the only thing that has had any effect was the Tylenol lowering my fever a bit.

I’m a 19-year-old male, roughly 80kg (176lbs) about 14% bf, and quite active (gym/running). I’m looking for advice or similar experiences regarding a lateral meniscus injury that looks bad on paper but feels ""okay"" in real life.

History:

I had a knee trauma about three months ago playing soccer. I got an MRI like a month ago because of some lingering pain.

The MRI Results (Translated from French):

Lateral Meniscus: Radial tear of the middle segment, described as ""quasi-transfixiant"" (almost going all the way through).

Cyst: Presence of a 30mm parameniscal cyst located between the meniscus and the IT band.

Medial Meniscus: Grade 2 degenerative lesion (minor).

Ligaments: ACL/PCL are intact. No cartilage damage.

My Symptoms (The confusing part):

Despite the radial tear (which I read is usually unstable), I have NEVER experienced knee locking.

Daily life: I used to have pain when walking down stairs, but that has calmed down significantly. I currently feel almost no real pain during the day.

Running: I’ve been going for 5k runs recently and preparing for a 10k in 2months. After the run, I feel a discomfort/pain especially when i put pressure on the lateral point of my knee and bend (about a 3/10).

Recovery: The morning after a run, the pain/discomfort drops to a 1/10 (basically non-existent after like a day of rest).

My Situation:

My doctor has mentioned PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) as a potential conservative option to try before considering arthroscopy, especially since I don't want to do Arthroscopic meniscectomy.

Questions for the community:

1. Has anyone else here managed a radial tear conservatively (without surgery)? I hear these are harder to heal than longitudinal tears.
2. Is running on this sustainable if the pain is this low, or am I silently destroying my knee because of the tear?
3. Did anyone have success with PRP for this specific type of tear?

I want to lead off by telling you all I have been to a primary care doctor 3 times in the last 10 weeks and have a specialist appointment next month. I am looking for outside opinions.  I am 5’10”, 143 pounds.

On October 5, approximately just under 10 weeks ago, seemingly out of nowhere I began experiencing some chest discomfort in various areas of my chest (Left pec area, right pec, rib cage, etc).  It never has been that painful. Mostly a 3 or so out of 10 at its worst when it occurs. Due to this, I believe I have began experiencing anxiety relating to these pains and the tension I think causes tightness in my trapezius muscles, in particular on the left side.  After a week of this, I visited the doctor because I thought it should have subsided if it simply something muscular.  After explaining my symptoms including some that might have been incidental at the time including a very light sore throat, neck pain some fatigue, and few headaches, the doctor thought maybe it was something viral.  We decided to do a Strep test because my throat appeared a bit irritated and a blood draw for Mono to rule that out as well as an Electrocardiogram to look for something maybe cardio related and “rule it out” for my own anxiety about it.  We weren’t too concerned with Covid or Flu as those are more straight forward to treat.  That Mono test came back negative and the doctor advised my ECG looked normal and if it was still occurring after a week to schedule another appointment.  My symptoms lessened over the course of the following week and then returned to similar levels.  This caused me to schedule a second visit.  During this visit, I expressed myself and I’m sure I seemed more worried about it.  During this visit, my doctor ordered more blood tests including a CBC, a D-Dimer for clots, and a Quant test.  All tests came back normal, however I never got to see the actual results. The doctor also ordered a chest x-ray with 2 views (side and back) that also came back normal.

The chest pains themselves are intermittent with multiple episodes during a day. Episodes last anywhere from under a minute to a few minutes at a time before subsiding for an indefinite amount of time.  When the pains occur they typically are in one location at a time, but I experience them in different locations over the course of the 10 weeks. Sometimes they are paired with pinpoint tenderness when I press on the area that hurts.  The pains also sometimes worsen with deep breaths during an episode but not always.  Over the course of these last 10 weeks, my symptoms have gotten fairly more mild and infrequent but still occurring.  There was one occurrence in the last 2 weeks where I had irritation (pain and maybe even something that felt like a burning sensation) at the surface level around my sternum.  That only occurred one day really.  

I had a 30 day follow up last week with no new information other than when I asked what they thought was wrong now that this has been going on a while and they said musculoskeletal is what they thought was most likely. I have a specialist appointment at a Cardiologist office in January and a follow up a week after with my PCP Doc.  If the cardiology stuff is negative we talked about blood tests to determine if it might be autoimmune related.

Can you give me any ideas on what you think is wrong or what to ask at my Cardiologist appointment?  Please let me know if you need more details or clarification.

I (20AFAB) am a trans guy on testosterone gel (46mg) every day, which I have been for about a year now. I’ve been on T gel for two years officially, but I started out on a lower dose (23mg) and upped it when I noticed my T levels were low and E levels higher than i preferred, which made me still get my period. Since I upped my dose, my period has been absent. I haven’t tested my hormone levels since, but have assumed that my levels are okay as my period is absent and I am masculinising at a proper rate. (Plus I sadly can’t afford to get my blood tests done frequently).

Fast forward to a couple of months ago, I noticed a foul smell and odd discharge, which I finally decided to address a few days ago when I went to a doctor. She took a swab of my discharge and sent it off for testing. Turns out I had an overgrowth of GBS, which was causing my issues. My doctor then prescribed me with 800mg three times a day of Phenoxymethylpenicillin for 7 days to treat the GBS. I’ve taken 11 of the 21 pills prescribed so far, and today, I felt cramps and suddenly started bleeding. It’s a medium amount of blood, and the cramps feel like how my period cramps used to feel. I’m quite alarmed as I haven’t experienced this for a year officially, and I find it strange that it occurred now while I’m taking antibiotics.

So, does anyone have any clue what could be causing this bleeding? I know that low T level is a possibility, but I just find it strange that it is coinciding with this antibiotic trial.

Age: Early 40s
Background: Retired Marine (20 years), previously very active (running and weightlifting daily), no prior history of similar symptoms.

Initial Onset — June 2024

I woke up suddenly with:

Both hands swollen to about twice their normal size
Severe neck stiffness and pain

I went to the ER:

X-rays of both hands were normal
They gave me a high dose of prednisone and wrist wraps (they suspected carpal tunnel)

Prednisone provided dramatic relief and all symptoms resolved while I was on it

My primary provider was concerned about the high dose and tapered me off.
She also ordered MRIs of both wrists — both were normal.

Symptom Return After Prednisone Taper (Late 2024)

After finishing prednisone:

Full return of symptoms, worse than before
Hand swelling, severe nerve-like pain, and neck stiffness
Shoulder pain in both shoulders
Lat muscles painful to touch
Marked weakness (couldn’t grip a bottle or tie my shoes)
Fingertips extremely painful to pressure

My doctor suspected arthritis and referred me to rheumatology.

Rheumatology Work-Up (March 2025)

Rheumatologist performed:

Extensive bloodwork
Urine tests
Imaging of shoulders and spine
Everything returned normal.

At this time I was on meloxicam, which did not help.

Symptoms progressed to:

Severe Swelling in both feet
Severe pain in the balls of my feet

Could barely walk, drive, sleep, or perform daily tasks

Rheumatologist said it might be an autoimmune reaction, restarted prednisone, and all symptoms again resolved. I felt normal. Regained strength.

Relocation &amp; Current Status (2025–2026)

After moving to Tennessee, I had to start the whole process over.
I slowly tapered myself off prednisone due to long-term risks.

Current management:

Meloxicam, which helps somewhat

But I still have:

Bilateral shoulder pain

Intermittent weakness

Occasional swelling of hands and feet

Sudden flare-ups in random locations

Example: woke up today with foot pain and tailbone pain, which may be gone tomorrow

Symptoms are unpredictable, migrating, and flare without an obvious pattern.

Concern / Question

I’m at a loss about what to do next.
I continue to receive inconsistent explanations:

Some doctors suspect autoimmune issues

Others focus on symptom management only

So far, no diagnosis has explained the episodes of swelling, pain, and weakness

Prednisone consistently resolves everything, but I am trying to avoid long-term steroid use

I’m looking for:

Possible conditions that match these symptoms

Recommended next steps (specialists, tests, imaging, labs)

Whether I should push for specific autoimmune or neuromuscular evaluations

Any insight into conditions that respond strongly to steroids but show normal imaging/labs and normal blood pressure.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

• It never happens during daytime naps or when I fall asleep in the morning.
• It only occurs at night, mostly when I’m mentally tired or overthinking.
• I breathe normally before it happens. I am not focusing on my breathing.
• I don’t feel stressed in the moment, but I am anxious in general lately.
• After some time it stops and I eventually fall asleep, but it ruins my nights.

I have decades of experience of surgeries and procedures, and this wasn't simply waking up in pain and being distressed. It was like I'd lost my mind. From what I have been told, I wouldn't let anyone near me when I woke up on my original ward, and started trying to lash out at staff who got close to me, and yelling at them to get away from me. At that point, my next of kin was called, I was moved to a private room, and that's where my recollection begins.

All I can recall is that every time a staff member came in, or tried to calm me, I would back up the bed and try and cower from them. It was a feeling of terror I haven't been able to ever truly describe. According to my next of kin, I was begging for everyone to leave, would violently react if anyone tried to touch me, and was acting completely and utterly opposite to the person I am. I can only describe it as feeling like a caged animal, who didn't know where it was, and didn't trust anyone. I can only liken it to the aggressive behaviour/personality shifts that I've witnessed in dementia patients, or those with brain injuries.

After several hours, I must have fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion, and all I recall is waking up the next morning, absolutely normal again. I was talking to staff politely and cheerfully, apologising profusely for what happened, and every staff member was shocked at the difference in me. What had been like a shift in mental status, was completely back to normal, some 24 hours after surgery.

It was never truly explained to me what had happened, and it has always left me unsettled. I have seen (from Dr. Google), that post-op delirium is something that exists, and I would be curious if any medical professionals have heard of or seen this before, and have any insight into causes, or whether it is entirely random, and whether (since it has happened once) it could happen again. I appreciate any input, as it still freaks me out to this day!

I see a therapist weekly. 

Saw pych earlier in the week and we switched stimulants, she said I could crush them since they are not extended release. I am getting more stable. Um it would have been really nice if someone told me that I should do that! lol  

We are trying to get a transdermal patch. I've seen others use that after gastric bypass. Well, why the heck am I getting the runaround getting my script filled. They claim they've never filled that med before and so they cant make any promises filling it. They recommended I go to a specialty pharmacy. Okay I did that and they dont ""deal"" with that class of medications.  

  
I am really frustrated....Like why even have that medication ""available"" if it wont/cant be filled???

I’ve seen many people say that you need to go on a calorie deficit or that you may not be tracking properly. But I find no matter how much I cut back I don’t seem to be getting slimmer. Now I’m not sure if that’s due to body dysmorphia or if I am actually not doing something correctly. I’ve tracked my calories and made sure to stop binging because that is something ive always struggled with. occasionally, I do eat a little bit more than I usually would but not as much as I would have in the past. I used to eat easily over 2000kcal in one sitting, whereas now I’ll eat around 500 over my limit. ive given myself 1200 for the day and a lot of the time will end up eating less than that simply because I don’t have the time. And during the summer I used to walk 10k every day and was quite active due to work. But now that winter has come, it is harder for me to go out to walk because i am also an asthmatic. why I’ve come to Reddit is because I feel like I might get better answers if I ask a question and give a bit of info. Now I know that eating little calories is not a good thing and that it should not happen all the time but unfortunately, it just seems to happen. but anyway, so I’m eating under my maintenance calories and I am trying to be as active as I can so why am I not getting slimmer? I feel like I’ve gotten to the point where anything I do I won’t get to where I want to be. And it’s made my depression much much worse, because I feel like I am not in control of myself or what happens to me. And like I said, I have been struggling with weight loss for as long as I can remember both of my parents are quite slim no one in my family is overweight so I don’t think it could be a genetic thing but I’m not sure, is it just I’m not putting in enough effort? anyway, to get to the point if anyone else has struggled with weight loss and managed to overcome it how did you do it because I keep looking on Google and Reddit and everything gives me the same advice of counting calories so I don’t understand what I am doing wrong because if I’m doing all the right things, why am I not getting the results that I want?

“Okay,” I said, not realizing the person who does this themself doesn’t want to, like I do, eat like a binge-eating raccoon. 

“Just stop eating when you’re full.”

“Okay,” I said, not realizing the person who does this themself doesn’t have a whacked-out, faulty “full sensor” like I do.

“Life is short. And therefore, I say to eat the brownie.”

“Okay,” I said, not realizing the person who does this doesn’t awaken the food demon by abstaining from abstaining from certain trigger foods. 

And the thing that all this advice had in common? It wasn’t that it was bad advice. After all, it worked for the advice giver. Instead, the commonality was that I was eager to believe it. More or less, I, or the part of my brain that has an unhealthy relationship with food, wanted to believe that I could have my literal cake and eat it too. Or, less vaguely, some part of me wanted to believe that I could have an unhealthy relationship with food, yet still be physically healthy. 

I wanted to believe that I could work out and burn off all the food I wanted to eat. Which was, indeed, ALL the food. I wanted to believe that stopping eating when full, which to me means stopping eating when gorged, would result in me being a healthy weight. I wanted to believe that I would be satisfied with eating just one brownie, and not the whole tray, awakening my food demons each time I had the one brownie, and then eating the whole tray as a result. And therefore, I took all of this advice with abandon, resulting in me gaining back all the weight I had lost.

But this time around? I don’t plan on gaining back the 200+ lbs I lost. And that’s because I don’t plan on taking advice that I’m eager to take. At least, not without closely examining it first, asking myself, “is this advice that I want to take, or advice my food-addicted brain wants to take?” Because if it’s the latter, it’s likely terrible advice for me. And the advice that will ACTUALLY result in me having a healthy relationship with food, which means a relationship that results in healthy mind and healthy body, is advice that, honestly, isn’t going to sound as fun as the terrible advice. And that’s because it means coming to terms with the fact that I’ll never be able to have my dream relationship with food: eating whatever I want, feeling nice and full, if not stuffed, while having low body fat and six-pack abs.

And of course, all of this raises the question, “how do I know if something will be good advice for me, then?” And the answer to that is a resounding, “I have no idea.” But what I do know is that bad advice is all around, and, in my experience, it is so much more impactful than the good advice…

We work together and I notice that she barely eats anything at all and I’m quite concerned. 

We had a chat today which she initiated because I generally chose not to comment on people’s bodies and she’s basically said that her team advised at her last check in that if she lost more they would need to tube feed her. Since then she’s gone on to lose another stone and recons she is only eating 500-600 kcals a day. Her reasoning is that she just doesn’t feel hungry anymore and food gives no pleasure, in the past she has mentioned that she hates the feeling of food being stuck which puts her off eating. 

I don’t really know how to support her, I asked what I could do and she said nothing. I’ve offered to bring food in for her or remind her to regularly eat but she said it won’t help.

Loss of motor skills, confusion, and memory loss that has been getting worse","Hi.. there's been something going on with my dad for a few years now, but yesterday it was the worst I've ever seen. His age is 80, he's male, caucasian, ex military, not sure what meds he takes at the moment. Through the years, he'll have periods where it'll be hard for him to walk, like he temporarily loses motor skills and sometimes it'll result in him falling. Sometimes this is accompanied with forgetfulness and confusion. Usually it ends up with him going to the hospital (or being ambulanced there because one time he hit his head), and then once he's there he seems better and the doctors say they don't see anything wrong. But then it happens again, whether the next day, or a few months or a year later.

Lately though, there will be days where he can't walk at all and we'll find him holding on to the counter, and it seems a lot worse than the last time. Yesterday, he was having trouble. My mom and I got him a chair, but he could only get himself on it half way, and we were struggling to hold him up to prevent him from falling to the floor or hitting his head, but it was hard for us because he's a big person.

He had total loss of control in his arms and one of his legs. But also he could barely talk, he could only get sounds out, and his breathing was labored. I thought he might be dying. But the ambulance got there. They said they saw signs of a minor stroke.

If it was a stroke, I still feel like there's something else going on that doctors have been missing because why would he have loss of motor skills sometimes in the past few years? It's just getting so hard for my mom and I to take care of him and prevent him from falling, and so I was wondering if anyone had any insight on what else could be happening?",,,,2025-12-05 18:00:36.913011+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-12-05 17:57:58,21427,7,,,[],"[""loss_of_motor_skills"",""confusion"",""memory_loss"",""falling"",""labored_breathing"",""speech_difficulty""]",[],"[""stroke""]",[],"[""loss of motor skills"",""confusion"",""memory loss"",""labored breathing"",""speech difficulty"",""minor stroke"",""falling""]",not_relevant,0.8,No bariatric or PBH-related context present,patient,0.8,"[""Symptoms"",""Conditions/Diagnosis""]",negative,,"[""anxiety"",""frustration""]","[""seeking_advice"",""sharing_experience""]",[],[],,1764957478,,,

We are new to this (4 weeks) and as you once have been are learning of a new world full of wonders, technology and frustration. We currently have 91%TIR and 5.9/107 median, with 5.6/101 waking average. We are (my kid) T1D, 14 years old and using a Tandem X2 pump. 

What we have not managed to figure out yet is how to properly BOLUS for a larger meal (dinner). I have read so many texts and comments, but I would like a personal experience from someone that has real practical experience and not a medical interpretation. Currently, we are mostly overshooting (up to 10-11/180-200 and then comes the low 3.5-4/63-72 after dinner for the past 3-4 days. Carb calculations are usually correct but we are GI unaware.

  
1. If you eat quick carbs, BOLUS first, wait 15 minutes and then eat. This is pretty straight forward, and it works (for the most part) as long as we calculate the carbs right. 

2. Should ALL carbs be calculated, or just sugar carbs? What is the point with the sugar carbs?

3. Should we be looking at the Glycemic Index of things? How do we interpret that? 

4. If you eat slow carbs, should you wait with the BOLUS? How long? We ate lentils the other day that contain LOTS of carbs but they are EXTREMELY slow and i did not know how slow until we had a super low incident 1 hour later. It seems that BASAL can probably handle lentils by itself... 

5. What do you do if you are too low 3.9/70 or very high 10/180, and you want to eat? If low, eat and don't BOLUS? If high, preBOLUS wait until it goes lower and then eat?

6. Some meals are extremely complex and hard to calculate the GI and total carbs, what is a good rule of thumb to use when BOLUSing? How much far off is it ok to miss a calculation? Would a pump compensate some for the BASAL it's giving, or would that come in addition?

Had a stress test 3-6 months ago. At follow up cardiologist said this will prolly be the highest performance in a stress test I see all year. We did the stress test because I had been getting intermittent chest pain while running. Cardiologist said it was in my head.

My VLDL-S had never been tested. My PCP tested it as part of my most recent lipid panel.

Results are 1 week old - 
Total Cholesterol- 103 
Triglycerides- 88 
HDL - 45
LDL - 41 
VLDL- s - 52.5 nm 

My PCP asked that I reach out to my cardiologist because she is concerned.

Cardiologist response was - Testing VLDLs is not a standard of practice because there is no medication to reduce it. Continue all meds  nothing further to be done.

I am having trouble accepting that response. Feels like I got…. Well sucks to be you nothing we can do. 

Worth my time seeking out a new cardiologist or is it just pretty much is what it is?

We are from Canada and we were visiting family in TX, when suddenly My wife had a miscarriage and heavy bleeding, required transfusion during her delivery admission. A CT w/o contrast after delivery done and showed suspected retained products with a recommendation for ultrasound during her delivery stay, but no ultrasound was done and she was discharged afternoon. 

Same day after 8h, we came back to the ED with Active heavy bleeding (she was literally pouring blood), Dizziness, Palpitations, Chest pain, Abdominal pain
Hgb dropped from 8.4 → 7.8, and Ultrasound confirmed retained products.

ED physician discharged her again with misoprostol at home only, despite, Active bleeding, Falling hemoglobin, Symptomatic anemia, Confirmed retained products on official US, and he stated that Gyn saw the report and said that it is a normal findings after delivery. 

We refused to take misoprstol at home. My concern was if she took the misoprstol, she will pass the product with a lot of blood then we would not be able to take care of her on time. He said we  should not be over-worried and that she is fine and does not require transfusion at the moment. I explained it twice that I know she is fine for now, but it is about anticipating a bad outcome.

We explicitly asked for at least ED observation or talking to the OB hospitalist oncall (who discharged her!) if misoprostol is planned. Declined by the ED physician and stated that the OB is not in the hospital, and ED do not have admission previlages. 
We ran out of options, so we asked him to document that we disagreed with discharge and politely asked to document that we are discharged against our concerns; chart instead says patient was “comfortable” and “agreed on plan,” which is not true.

She went home, worsened, returned again after 8h with Hgb 7.4 → ended up with, Massive hemorrhage, 1.6L blood loss during emergent D&amp;C, 3 units PRBC + FFP + platelets. What the surgeon said is that she had a part of the placenta blocking the uterus with blood accumulating above it (that’s why she lost the 1.6L immediately when they removed the product). 

This was clearly predictable and preventable from the CT in the delivery admission. 

I’m now filing a formal complaint with the hospital, but honestly I want advice from people who’ve been in similar situations:

But what is the proper next step here?

This has been emotionally devastating and medically terrifying.
What is also disgusting is to see a colleague lying in the chart; I was talking to him as my colleague, and I really respected everyone in the team and did not interfere with anything the do or sat, I really did not intend to do anything more, but this is really disgusting.

For context, an ingrown hair led to an abscess on my upper right thigh. It was just kind of sore, but then throughout the course of a few days it swelled up to a small golf ball, and so I went to the emergency room. They told me it wasn't bad enough to where it would have to be lanced, and that I could just take cephalexin orally and it would resolve itself. Since then - two days ago - it has been getting bigger, it is excruciating to walk now, whereas it was not before, like I barely can take a step and I'm limping, and it seems to be getting worse? It now has almost a head to it, and I'm afraid that it's going to pop and leave me with a huge lesion. I was told to give it at least a full course of antibiotics before returning to the er, otherwise I would have already gone back, but I feel like maybe I should disregard that advice and just go back anyway since it's getting worse.

 I was told not to cover it with anything, and to keep it clean, and rinse it with peroxide twice a day. If I was going out, I was to wrap it in gauze gently, and not put too much friction on it. I haven't put pants on at all, and have just stayed indoors as a result. I haven't put friction on it. I haven't covered it. I've kept it clean the way they told me to. I'm not sure why it's getting worse, and the pain is almost unbearable. Thoughts?

Some information about myself -
I'm a 29 year old female, I live in the United states, Southern East coast. 
I'm prescribed hydromorphone 12 mg every 4 hours for an unrelated back injury. That's the only medication I take, outside of the cephalexin that I was prescribed for this, every 8 hours, orally.  This abscess is so painful that unless I take my medication, I can't walk, at all. It hurts more than my back does. It's to the point where I need to rigorously take very strong opioid pain relievers to even be able to tolerate the pain in my leg. I don't think that's normal.

Abscess history: The ingrown hair appeared about 8 Days ago, swelled up into a ball about 2 to 3 days after that, and then five days in is when I went to the er. The day after the er, when I started the course of antibiotics is when it started to grow even bigger and hurt excruciatingly. It did not hurt that bad before, now it's unbearable.

I’m 26F and about 5 feet, 105 pounds. Not under any medication or has any existing illnesses. 

I have a submental lymph node that has been around for months (or could be for the last couple of years tbh). It’s not visible at first glance but as I am kinda skinny, it would be obvious when I lift my head up. When the doctor was feeling it, she said that it’s really soft and doesn’t look or feel concerning to her. I have gotten an ultrasound scan last month and the result came out normal, with nothing suspicious. But the doctor did mention that ultrasound result would not be able to capture what it really is and she said that she could refer me to a specialist if I want. I have no other bad symptoms apart from the visibility of it. She flag it as non-urgent and hence, my appointment to see the specialist is not immediate. 

I’m thinking of rescheduling my appointment next Monday as I have urgent work that doesn’t allow me to take leave but this would mean that I might delay it for another month due to it being a public hospital. I’m honestly paranoid every single day and I’m not sure if it’s due to paranoia, but I can see it all the time now, especially in photos and videos when I show my left side profile (the node is on my left under chin). I don’t know…will it turn from something harmless to something harmful if I delay the specialist appointment for a few more weeks…? Otherwise I would have to go to private hospital to get it check.

I think it's been healing pretty well but I noticed this morning it looked grey... And 12 hours later it still does.

My father has a diagnosed esophageal issue that I do not know the name of. I did text him, but he won’t get back to me until later on.

I gave two main issues going on that make me wonder about seeing a GI specialist.

Firstly, I seem to have developed IBS or something similar in the last 12 months. I go from not having a movement for days, to having uncontrollable, emergent movements. Before you ask, yes I’ve kept a food diary and cannot make any discernible connections to triggers other than alcohol (but not always alcohol).

Secondly, I have a hard time swallowing. I often feel like food gets stuck at the bottom of my esophagus. Sometimes, it even feels like it comes back up. It takes lots of swallows and water to eat. This has been happening since I think high school. Worsened in periods of anxiety, of course, but overall very uncomfortable and concerning to me.

I’ve never brought any of this up to my pcp because she is rather conservative in her practice, and I’ve always just pinned it in anxiety and emetophobia making me “imagine”  sensations in my stomach. However I’m thinking that having a family history of GI disorders, that it might not be all in my head.

I have 3 kids: 1st was vaginal, last two were cesarean. No issues noted during C-section and post partum stay in hospital either than hbp that I've had since delivery (not formerly) so taking labetalol for now 

Have experienced continuous heavy bleeding since c section. 

At around 6 weeks I had worsening excruciating cramps. OB said I had bacteria in my urine but they were unsure of origin and gave me 10 day antibiotic treatment. The extreme cramps died down, but heavy bleeding continued.

At around 10 weeks bleeding became even heavier (dark maroon filling huge pads every 1.5-2 hrs, at times every 1 hr if active). OB prescribed 10 day progesterone treatment, but the bleeding just got worse so she sent me to ER after a few days

ER did tv ultrasound and saw 1cm mass, but sent me home since blood levels were ok. They gave me IV TXA, which did nothing. My ob then prescribed me a 5 day treatment of TXA which eventually did slow the bleeding to just spotting a few days ago.

My ob then sent me to a gyno consultant who scheduled me for D&amp;C/hysteroscopy yesterday. The surgeon was adamant before the surgery that she didn't think it was retained placenta due to negative hcg test. 

Surgeon called my husband after the procedure (since I was out of it) and said maybe it's a fibroid with some retained placenta attached to it? But that she's really still not convinced it's retained product due to negative pregnancy test. Then she said we just won't know what it is until tests come back. Could be two weeks.

This seems absurd to me - retained placenta stuck to a fibroid is basically unheard of according to my Google searches. But if it's not RPOC, then what the hell is it? It looks like necrotic tissue, no?

Any insights would be much appreciated, ty. I am impatient and scared, and now broke lol (am in the US).

Looking for relief options without diagnosis [39M],"Been having significant issues breathing for a month now. It's like I'm sucking air in through a straw. My throat always feels tight and constricted, and I feel like I'm drowning most days. Blood oxygen stays at 98-99%, but inhaling feels difficult like I'm encountering resistance, and the majority of the air gets trapped in my throat and doesn't make it to my lungs.

The only way I can get any sort of air flow going is if I inhale hard through my nose and my throat at the same time.  Basically forcing the air in, and almost making it feel normal-ish, but this is pretty exhausting to keep doing and seems to put strain on my neck/throat muscles.

My best guesses for now are that either my airway is heavily constricting due to allergies or something else, or my body is having trouble generating enough pressure to allow the inhale to complete naturally, possibly due to some kind of diaphragm dysfunction.

This could've been caused by a whole host of things, but the problem is that I need to wait months to get tests at an allergic clinic, and my appointment with a pulmonologist is also months away. In the meantime, I don't have any clear coughing or wheezing that indicates standard asthma, and my breathing sounds normal to my doctor when they listened to it, so I haven't been prescribed an inhaler or any inhaled corticosteroids.

At the same time, I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. I feel like I'm in hell, waking up everyday just to suffer, and the difficulty breathing makes falling sleep almost impossible. I've had several nights where I was up for hours just laying there struggling.

What can I do on my own or talk to my doctor about to get some relief before more testing is done?

https://imgur.com/a/45NwPKD

I’m a 22 year old female, 160cm and 80kg. I am wondering if any doctors can help interpret my iron results. I’ve had these kind of results for a couple of years now, with normal iron and low-normal ferritin, but strange levels for the rest. My doctors think I might be a ‘bad absorber’ of iron or have some kind of underlying autoimmune disease. I have textbook symptoms of iron deficiency such as fatigue, pallor and headaches almost daily.
For reference I have had coeliac testing performed and was negative. I also took iron supplements daily for 100 days, however my results in August after these 100 days show not much of a change. I’m getting a colonoscopy in the next few months as my dad has Crohn’s disease, but I doubt I have the condition as I don’t have symptoms. I also do not have heavy periods (skip most using BC) and I’m not vegetarian etc. I take daily birth control and Venlafaxine 75mg for anxiety. I don’t smoke or take drugs and don’t have any other health issues.
Next week I’m getting an iron infusion to see if this helps with my symptoms and raise my ferritin, but hoping a doctor might be able to help interpret these results.

Thanks so much!

I wanted to make sure he was ok, I only called the police because he was looking for his gun planning on hurting himself. When the police saw my injuries, and the scratches he had from me I told them what he did. I begged them to just take him to psych hold but had to arrest him. The EMTs checked me out and recommended I go to the hospital but said it was up to me. 

As days went on my eyes were so bad they could barely open, but healed pretty fast. I'm still having a bit of trouble walking still because I'm bruised from the knees all the way down to my whole foot on both legs. There's bruises still healing all over me but aren't causing me much pain anymore.

Since my eyes have started to heal my eyesight feels worse. 

I have bad light sensitivity, things are a lot more blurry, and it feels harder to read clearly and process as well.

Could I have damaged my eyes from the black eyes, or even got a concussion? Will this go away and improve on its own or do I have to go to the hospital.

I also had a pretty intense seizure (Psychological Non-epileptic Seizures), earlier that day so I don't know if maybe thats just why I've been feeling so weird along with this tough situation I'm going through.

My doctor recommends waiting 2 months before biopsy. Is this a reasonable approach?!,"About me: 22-year-old woman, Spain
Diagnosis: Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL)
Treatment: Completed 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH
Current condition: Feeling well and asymptomatic

⸻

What the recent PET/CT showed
-New mediastinal nodules with very high FDG uptake (SUV up to 22, Deauville 5)
-Described as peripheral hypermetabolism with central necrosis
-A new left hilar node and small lung opacities that could be inflammatory

⸻

What my doctor explained

My doctor thinks the PET findings are very likely active disease, but he believes an immediate biopsy in this location could be dangerous so soon after chemotherapy,mainly due to:
-low marrow reserve
-higher risk of significant bleeding
-higher risk of serious infection

He ordered a repeat PET/CT in about 2 months. His plan is to wait aftwr that, then perform a 'safer' biopsy that provides enough tissue to choose the correct second-line therapy (possibly CAR-T or other salvage options).



⸻

Why I’m asking here

I understand no one can diagnose me online, but I would appreciate insight from doctors familiar with lymphoma on whether this timing is typical or if earlier biopsy is usually preferred.

⸻

Questions
	1.	In PMBCL, is it medically reasonable to delay biopsy for several weeks when new Deauville 5 lesions appear, in order to reduce bleeding/infection risk after intensive chemo? 
	2.	Is a ~2-month interval commonly used, or would a shorter wait normally be considered?
	3.	For young patients with suspected refractory PMBCL, what second-line options are generally recommended once biopsy confirms progression (e.g., salvage chemo + auto-SCT, CAR-T, clinical trials)?

⸻

I have the full PET report, pathology, and treatment summary available if helpful.
Thank you very much to anyone who can offer perspective or share experience, it would really help me understand the reasoning behind this plan.

Incident: Cat scratch with no blood A stray cat Country: Egypt Gender: Female Height: 164 Age: 19 So my story is a little strange. I was scratched by a cat on holiday in egypt. this happened on the 15th September. I got seen by a doctor who recommended me the vaccine. I got the first dose 16th September (less than 24hrs after exposure). Upon return to the UK(where i live), i went to a&amp;e and explained them the situation. without proper examination, as the scratch has basically healed and was pretty much invisible, they said i did not need any PEP vaccines and just to move on. That’s what i did, until 11 weeks later. I kept on having anxiety over it, so i reached out to health protective services here in the UK, who recommended me to still finish the vaccines and go straight to a&amp;e to get them. which is what i did. I have gotten my second dose exactly 11 weeks after my 1st dose and i am now scheduled to do my 3rd and 4th dose. My question is, when i finish my vaccines(do all 4 doses), it will be 98 days after exposure happened, so will it protect me from this exposure? I have no symptoms apart from what i suspect to be anxiety symptoms like tight jaw from grinding my teeth. I have read that cat scratches that don’t draw blood are low risk, but then i’ve also read that if a scratch didn’t bleed it doesn’t mean it didn’t break skin. The cat did appear healthy, i was feeding it a few days prior to the scratch and it was playful, but i also know that it can take a bit for them to show symptoms. i was unable to monitor the cat as i had to return back to the UK. The cat is most likely unvaccinated as it was a stray who just stayed by the resort.

My mental health deteriorated earlier this year over three months when I started wegovy. I started cycling rapidly between hypomania and depression which continued to get worse until I realised that it was affecting the absorption of my oral medication. I stopped the wegovy, but instead of getting better, I continued to get worse. I ended up getting fired from my job because I literally could not sit at a desk so wasn't getting any work done, and my increasingly erratic behaviour.

I keep a very detailed tracker of my mood, including things like mood, affect, and sleep. I now have enough data to do analysis and identify patterns and correlations. The most common symptoms logged were some variation of restlessness, agitation, and tired but wired. 

It got to the point a few weeks ago where I was constantly pacing, feeling like I was crawling out of my skin, and intense dysphoria as well as anxiety about going to bed, and mental agony if i wasn't moving. I didn't sleep for five days, stopped being able to eat, and 24 hours a day I paced up and down my one bedroom apartment (9 steps long) until I was too exhausted to walk, so then I put on knee pads because I have a tiled floor and crawled up and down until I was too exhausted even for that I just lay on the floor and cried until I had enough energy to get up and do it all again. It was literally torture. 

I ended up going to the urgent clinic because I was having excruciating pain localised to the rectum and passing just bloody mucus. However, the doctor was very alarmed about my mental state and saw I was about to tip into manic psychosis, so sent me to the emergency department in a taxi. I was so dysphoric and restless that I left before being triaged. I was sent back that night but left again after 3.5 hours and walked home in the rain at 3.30am because I was convinced that everyone in the waiting room was whispering about and laughing at me. I thought that an elderly woman in a wheelchair was a suicide bomber. I also started to think that I should upload my mind to the cloud and do away with my physical body so I could exist just as a mind. 

When I left during the day, I was too exhausted to keep walking, but I happened to be outside the community mental health clinic so I crawled into the lift and dragged myself out. at this point I had lost my shoes and a lot of my clothes somewhere along the way. I went to the bathroom, and with absolutely no thought or consideration I ripped off my belt and tried to hang myself from the hook on the back of the door. Obviously it didn't hold my weight and broke. When I landed on the floor I thought ""phew, I'm glad that didn't work.""

The third doctor I saw about the rectum issue was also very alarmed at my mental state and sent me back to hospital with my aunt who stayed with me to make sure I didn't leave again. I was so restless and in pain from my rectum that I couldn't sit or lie down, but eventually I was so exhausted that I was lying on the floor of the ED waiting room still writhing in mental and physical agony for 6 hours. Finally I got seen and given 10mg of diazepam so I could be still enough for a CT. it gave me relief for nearly 20 hours. Nothing was found in the CT or stool sample, but it cleared up on its own so who the fuck knows what that was about. 

I saw a psychiatrist as a one off assessment who diagnosed me with severe akathisia as well as rapid cycling mood. It finally all made sense. 

So far I've been taking orphenadrine at night and procyclidine during the day with diazepam for if things get unbearable. They worked really well for five days, then I kept waking up after 3 hours and the procyclidine was only giving relief for a couple of hours and i can only take twice a day. I'm getting intense and very distressing break through symptoms. It's so awful but I have to be careful with the diazepam because it gives complete relief for at least 12 hours and I'm tempted to just take it all the time to ease the pain. When it's bad, any kind of stimulation exacerbates intensely so I couldn't go outside and needed silence. 

Last night it was really bad and I put dumbbells in two backpacks and zip tied then on to me. I walked up and down the waterfront for a couple of hours until i managed to get myself home. Today, I was walking across a bridge, and again with no thought I jumped onto the railing and was about to jump off when two members of the public dragged me back. I ran away to avoid the police. 

I don't actually want to die, but when it gets bad I get extremely impulsively suicidal. I truly believe that I'm going to go through with it with no warning which would be so tragic given that most of the time I'm not actually that consciously suicidal. I honestly don't know what I can do to stop it. It's kind of even more dangerous than a suicidal person with a plan because it could happen any time anywhere with no way to prevent it. 

I've been given some alternative treatment options which I'm not feeling happy about - propranolol (which I've taken before and hated because it felt like I couldn't breathe and was going to die), mirtazapine (which is ill advised given the bipolar), or changing whatever drug it is that I'm taking that is the offender. Coming off or reducing the dose of olanzapine much is not an option. If I didn't have the injection of it I'd be manic in the stratosphere after days of not sleeping at all, but I  could feel that the ceiling it provides was going to crack. 

I can now get a few hours sleep with the orphenadrine, but I'm pretty desperate to find something more effective that works for longer than a few hours. I'm softening to the idea of propranolol, but would be very appreciative if someone could give me some more options for relief, because this is hard to convey, but it's literally torture. 

I don't know what I can do about the impulsive suicide attempts except for effectively treating the akathisia. I'm just at a loss and so exhausted that I may not be able to hold on much longer.

Any potential solution or just something that eases some of the suffering would be so much appreciated. 

Please, I'm begging for someone to help me before it's too late.

I had a heart monitor put on but every time I pressed the button for one of these events there was no indication that anything was going on. No PVC, no PAC, nothing. I’ve since had my ablation and my PVCs are gone but the weird pausing feeling still lingers, typically during the night time. I get this rush of adrenaline like something is wrong and it feels like my heart has voided and my body momentary feels like it’s falling for a split second and I catch my breath like I’ve just been thrust down a rollercoaster. I just can’t figure out what’s causing it. I can feel it directly within my heart. I’ve had an ultrasound of my heart done as well beforehand and everything came back fine. It hasn’t really hindered my life in any big way, but it’s very annoying and the rushes of adrenaline from it aren’t fun.

I have had a history of minor lip inflammation since January 2023, which started practically out of nowhere. At first, it was very mild. I have always used Aquaphor as a lip balm because I took Accutane in 2022, and my lips have been permanently dry ever since.

Additionally, since then I have been using SLS-free toothpastes, such as Curaprox Enzycal 1450, and ultra-soft toothbrushes.

I started using Invisalign in March 2023, and my treatment cycle ended in December 2024. During that time, the inflammation persisted, but was located more around the mouth area.

After finishing the main Invisalign cycle, I switched to retainers in January 2025. I replace them every 6 months—which I find quite gross, though I try to keep them clean. Furthermore, I started using fluoride toothpaste (Curaprox Enzycal 1450) only in the morning.

For the rest of my brushing sessions (usually 3 or 4 times a day), I use Curaprox Enzycal Zero. However, the inflammation remained roughly the same.

A few weeks ago, however, my lips started to get worse for no apparent reason, looking as they do in the images below. Just today, I also noticed some small lesions inside my mouth and a whitish/slightly yellowish discoloration at the back.

It’s not very clear in the photo, but earlier this week I had pimple-like bumps on my lip that looked very similar to whiteheads, specifically with yellowish tips.

I am going to see a dermatologist and a dentist, but I wanted to know if anyone has experienced something similar.

What can I say, it works. Im finally not starving during the day or at night, despite eating only 1250 cal and exercising 5 times per week. Ive already lost some weight.

I've been considering getting back into it, but I was still uncertain.

I checked my testosterone levels a while back, and they were on the lower end of average. I have gynecomastia, I grew up on the chubbier side, I’m only 5’9”, and I have long femurs (and a short torso), relatively high calf insertions, and bicep gaps, all of which didn’t seem like very good signs regarding genetics. For one thing, I was having trouble with my squat form when I was trying to improve it back when I was still going to the gym, just to still have issues with it. I thought I made progress with my calves when comparing with progress pictures about 5-6 months apart, just for them to be the same measurements.

I also felt like the ship already sailed when it comes to getting in shape since almost all of the guys online started in grade school or grew up playing sports (which I didn’t). And I'm not actively trying to find excuses to get out of trying to get in shape - I’ve had self-esteem issues in most parts of my life, and didn’t think I'd feel great if I spent years lifting (which I could barely get myself to enjoy) just to still feel poorly about myself compared to other men because of things I could never change about myself, such as those I mentioned. I know there are other benefits like health, discipline etc. but I guess I had a bit of a nihilistic viewpoint on that in a way, where it felt like I'd still feel poorly about myself regardless of how healthy I am physically. I suspect like it's likely an inner mental issue beyond the gym I should work to resolve, but I tried therapy before, it didn't get anywhere, and I'm honestly convinced that I inherently can't develop a good mindset.

What’s strange is that I don’t feel like I look any different. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a noticeable change yet, but the scale told me something my eyes couldn’t. And that hit me harder than I expected. It reminded me that progress doesn’t always show up right away, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.

I’ve been trying so hard to stay consistent, even on the difficult days or the days I went over my calories. And despite everything I’ve been dealing with, this small bit of progress brought a kind of relief and pride I haven’t felt in a long time. 😭

It also reminded me that eating around 1,800 calories isn’t something I should feel guilty about, that I can fuel my body and still move forward. That realization alone felt emotional.

It might be a small step, but today it showed me that I’m still moving in the right direction.

Apparently insurance (in USA) is more likely to cover WM programs/providers if you have severe sleep apnea. Part of the WM program intake is running labs, and turns out I probably have full blown diabetes. I found out 2 days ago and have been fairly upset, depressed, even mad. My results:

A1C = 8.3%
Insulin = 50.1 uIU

My PCP ran labs almost exactly a year ago and ran a ""glucose, random"" test that returned normal and stated I had a low risk of diabetes. I am going through the stages of grief currently, but feeling very angry that I went from ""low diabetes risk"" to ""full blown diabetes"" in a year? I know generally the internet is the enemy, but everything points to I should have had more than a year between non-diabetic and diabetic lab results, especially since I show at least some of the risk factors (obesity, sedentary job, etc).

I haven't had my follow-up yet, but need to go back to my PCP to confirm and start treatment. I have had several other negative experiences from this same provider (took 9 months to resolve a persistent non-COVID wet cough, rushed through another appointment about an infected ruptured cyst with no care instructions -- both of which I subsequently had to visit an urgent care for). Would it be a set back to try to find a new PCP right now? Should I just visit my current PCP to start treatment and then find a new one? I just don't think I can trust them. Even if they didn't do anything technically wrong I think I will probably blame and/or distrust them going forward. They also didn't give me any pain relief when changing an IUD which was excruciating.

I would also love to hear if this has happened to other people. I thought I had more time to course correct, especially because my PCP never mentioned that I needed to make immediate changes.

Prior today, pain was when I needed to use my abdominal muscles, bending, picking up, rolling over in bed, etc. I thought maybe it was an issue with my psoas so I used a ball to try to release the tightness. It seemed to help, or last night it didn't feel worse.
This morning I woke up with constant pain at the 6-8 pain level. Decided to go to urgent care and they sent me to the ER.
Today's blood work and urine ruled out kidney issues.  I'm waiting for the results from a CT scan. 

The prior two times the CT didn't show anything. In November, they did find a fibroid on an ovary but they didn't feel it was related.

I couldn’t let it go. So I took her to the er. They did a mobile bedside xray (front and side view). Of course nothing was there. But this is a rural old hospital.

I have never smoked and I do not consume alcohol. This year, I have been experiencing many gastric and digestive problems, ranging from immediate diarrhea after meals to excessive gas. Throughout the year, I have undergone several exams, especially from September until now. I had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, several blood tests, an abdominal ultrasound, and also a total abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. All these exams came back normal. However, during this time, I developed an extreme fear regarding pancreatic cancer, due to feeling back pain, a persistent burning sensation in my abdomen, and also a very large increase in my diabetes test results. I did a test on September 27th which showed my level was pre-diabetic, and now, on November 29th, the same test gave a much higher value, which already indicates diabetes... I am becoming extremely worried about all of this, so I would like to know if my concern is truly valid or if I am overreacting.

The report from my total abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast says the following:

'Liver with preserved morphology and attenuation.
There is no dilation of the intra or extra-hepatic bile ducts.
Pancreas with preserved morphology. There is no dilation of the main pancreatic duct.
Spleen is normal.'""

The test I performed for diabetes was the Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c), which in September came with a value of 5.74\% and now in November 7.74\% (I don't know if the measurements are the same in other countries).

more recently it has gone bigger so I went to the emergency room and they did an ultrasound which didn’t even show the lump it showed a completely normal ultrasound.

I got sick with a mystery respiratory illness about eight years ago. It happened very suddenly, like over the course of a few seconds while I was out walking my dog after work one night. I felt something in the vicinity of my sternum sort of constrict and since then, I've not had one single, satisfying, whole breath. I haven't been able to pull in enough air to yawn for eight years. I need you, reading this, to understand that I feel like I've been drowning a little bit every single second of every single day for eight years. I feel it when I sleep. It's the first thing I notice in the morning and the last thing I think about at night. No history of drug use, 3 drinks a year max, have smoked all of once in my life. I'm 5'6"" and consistently about 140 lbs.

Obviously, because I had a 27-year-old female body with no previous physical issues and a history of depression (that had never manifested like this before), the ER went for ""panic attack,"" gave me some Xanax, and sent me home, but the morning after, it was pretty clear it wasn't a panic attack, and since then I've seen an endless suite of doctors. Cardiologist, pulmonologists x2, ENT x2 (one of whom wouldn't do any diagnostics, the other told me I might have ""boyfriend stress""), therapist, psychiatrist, PFTs, ultrasounds, several X-rays, a CT scan of my chest, countless blood tests, countless allergy and GERD medications, benzos, SSRIs, an NDRI. I started seeing the latter two after the initial ER visit when they diagnosed me with GAD and I still see them consistently, partly because the other doctors won't engage with me if I don't front-load the initial 30 seconds of an appointment with, ""I regularly see a psychiatrist and a therapist"" to avoid the dreaded psychosomatic dx.

The thing is, my physical illness is the genesis of the anxiety, and not the other way around. I know everyone says that, and I do have PTSD and depression, I've had them since I was 13, but because I've lived with it for so long I know very keenly that the fact that I can't get my doctors to look at me as anything *but* a pathetic malingering woman I can't keep trying to reverse psychology myself into pretending I don't have a serious physical issue that hasn't been aided by therapy or psychiatric medication. I do have increased suicidal ideation, but again, that's because I *feel like I'm drowning every second of every day*, and I try to explain that, but it just gets flipped around again: the depression gives you breathing issues. It doesn't matter how many times I explain that when I breathe out sometimes the air exhaled from my nostrils goes so far upwards that it puffs my bangs out of my eyes or that I get insane velcro feelings in the trunk of my body when I breathe in and out: it's all psychosomatic. I managed to get an ENT yesterday who wasn't an ass and he wants to rule out stenosis, so I'm happy to be getting momentum again.

My psychiatrist is an older man who hasn't really retained much information about me in the almost decade I've been seeing him. I lost my parents recently and haven't been able to make appointments as timely as he'd like, so he's very short with me when we do meet. I have told him before that I find him difficult to talk to because he routinely dismisses my psychiatric and physical concerns; I came out to him last time we met and asked if he knew of any resources for my transition and he just fully did not acknowledge the question at all. I've been trying to get assessed for ADHD by this specific guy for years because my executive dysfunction was bad *before* I got ill and now it's a compounding problem that I have no energy and no focus and get winded easily &gt; stuff in my house piles up &gt; I get even more depressed about my living space not being clean, but after a certain threshold it just gets so overwhelming that my brain shuts down any attempts to get up to do something about it.

Today at our appointment, I tried to tell him this: that the executive dysfunction issues have been so bad all my life and now that I'm grieving and dealing with incredibly burdensome health issues they're getting exponentially worse. He flatly declined because the medication apparently increases risk of depression, but I genuinely cannot see how it could possibly be any worse than it is now. Do I even want an assessment from him if he's telegraphing that he doesn't think it's an issue?

He also threatens to 5150 me quite a lot, which is fair because I do have a lot of suicidal ideation (again, because I can't breathe) and my father and grandfather kept guns, so since they're dead now those are mine and I know that if I tell him this, even though they're in a safe I can't access because I deliberately don't know the access codes and I've taken all of my own guns to my uncles for safekeeping he will absolutely have me held lol

The thing is though that I don't really think other psychiatrists would be different, given everything around my medical history. Do I just stay with him because he signs off on my medication and gives me a respectable appearance of dutifully attending to my mental health while I look for a more comprehensive diagnosis?

**I would really appreciate if a Dr could tell me what’s likely to happen at the appt. Please do not be rude about me waiting so long, I’m unlearning medneglect** 

29F light smoker was taking aspirin and ibuprofen but they didn’t help. 
I have an appt with my GP on the 16th, what should I expect? 


Since sometime in October, I’ve had constant headaches localized to near my right temple. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but I’d rank them at around 4-5 on the pain scale, going up to 7-8ish if I strain, stand, or lay down. I have not sustained a head injury lol. 

About a week ago, I noticed my skull in that area is bulging, the temple on the other side doesn’t do that. I know for a fact it was not already like that lol. The bulge isn’t tender, nor is the rest of my scalp. 

I’ve been having a few other weird symptoms but idk if they’re relevant. Can’t think of words, or if i think of them I can’t say them (sometimes just stutter real bad, other times I skip words etc), randomly being super cranky (might be from the pain) and even more balance problems than usual (I’ve always been a lil clumsy lol). No fever but my lymph nodes are kinda swollen i think. 

When I made the appointment the recep told me it “sounds urgent” and to bug them until I got a sooner appt which made me kind of nervous.

Over the past year I've had these random bouts of extreme pain in my back/side on (alternating) left and right side. But it's gotten more frequent over the past few months. I assume it's a uti. It's the kind of pain where you can't sit still, walking around just hoping it stops. I've had a kidney stone and I'd compare that pain to this.

I always plan to go to the doctor or even er when it gets excruciating, but by the time (within 24 hours but usually way less) I'm able to go the pain suddenly vanishes. 

I'd assume it might be something else if it weren't paired with sometimes also struggling to pee and empty my bladder. So I've just kinda come to accept maybe I'm really prone to utis but my body is okay at fighting them off?

Something that I tried to understand while everything was happening is how come they kept sitting her body up while they were trying to resuscitate her? They would do a round of CPR and were squeezing blood and fluids into her body and everytime they sat her up, she would get a light pulse?

No history of alcohol use, drugs, or smoking. Medical history of hypothyroidism, migraines, GERD, chronic constipation, and depression. 

A few months ago I noticed floating stools that became more and more consistent. Occasional sharp right upper quadrant abd pain that radiates to the back. My liver function and pancreatic function blood work was normal. My fecal elastase was 140, and my GI doctor diagnosed me with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and started me on Creon. No mention of any other testing to get to the bottom of why I now have this insufficiency. I did ask for further testing and a regular abd ultrasound was done and was normal. Ca 19-9 =10. 

I had an abdominal MRI with and without contrast: Impression
No acute findings; specifically, pancreas is unremarkable. 
Narrative
CLINICAL HISTORY: Abdominal pain, pancreatic insufficiency.  COMPARISON: CT dated 10/17/2024. Right upper quadrant ultrasound dated 11/04/2025.  TECHNIQUE: MRI of the pancreas was performed with multiplanar, multiecho  sequences of the abdomen before and after the uneventful  administration of 6 mL intravenous Vueway.   FINDINGS: Pancreas is normal in size with slightly decreased T1 intrinsic  hyperintensity. No pancreatic mass. No pancreatic ductal dilatation.  No biliary ductal dilatation. The right posterior duct arises from  the left hepatic duct.  Nontargeted evaluation of the liver, spleen, bilateral adrenal  glands, gallbladder, and left kidney is unremarkable. Liver is  non-steatotic. Hepatic vasculature is patent. A few renal cysts are  present within the right kidney including a right upper pole cyst  measuring 2.5 cm with internal septations; no abnormal enhancement.  No dilated loops of bowel. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. No  lymphadenopathy.

When I read the results of the MRI, I focus on the findings section that mentions decreased T1 intrinsic hyperintensity and don’t understand what that means. Should this be something that I should be questioning the significance of? Are there other tests that are commonly done to find out the cause of the exocrine pancreatic insufficiency? I guess I’m trying not to over worry but don’t want to not be more diligent if I need to be.

I’m 31F, 66 kg, 5’1”, currently taking 5 mg levocetirizine daily and 0.5 mg clonazepam at night for insomnia. 

I had a big episode with my skin April 2025 that lasted about 4 weeks total. I’m hoping someone can help me make sense of what’s happening with my skin.

My timeline / symptoms:
	•	Day 1: A rash suddenly appeared. I coincidentally had a GP appointment, she said it would probably fade.
	•	I started 10 mg levocetirizine that same day.
	•	The ungodly rash kept spreading over the next week to points of unbearable itching and burning 
	•	Around day 7: I was prescribed prednisone and a class 4 steroid cream (clobetasol) this finally brought things under control.
	•	When tapering off prednisone, the rash spread to new areas again.
	•	After stopping the steroid cream for a few days, the rash returned then disappeared 
	•	Heat triggers fast flare-ups. if one side of my body gets warm (sleeping on my side, exercising, hot weather), a rash appears within minutes.

Diagnostic confusion:
I’ve been sent back and forth between allergists and dermatologists at two different hospitals.
An allergist initially thought chronic urticaria, but after seeing photos said it didn’t look typical and sent me to dermatology.
Dermatology diagnosed eczema/atopic dermatitis, partly because I also have hay fever.

What’s confusing me:
My flare-ups behave like hives and eczema at the same time:
	•	They appear within minutes. very hive-like, I can literally watch them spread
	•	Then they stay, dry out, and become eczema-like patches
Heat makes it significantly worse.

It still feels allergic, but doesn’t quite match chronic urticaria either.

Patch test results:
I had the standard European patch test.
The only positive was to the composite plant family (Asteraceae).
I’m also known to be allergic to tree pollen, grass pollen, and cats, but I don’t knowingly come into contact with composite plants

More prick testing allergy tests to come in the near future but does anyone have any leads at all because I seem to be a mystery between 5 doctors!!

I’m **17 years and 1 month old** and I’ve been really worried about my testosterone, and honestly I don’t even understand what’s causing this.

About a year ago I tested my **total T and it was 405 ng/dL**. I just did labs again and now it’s **428 ng/dL**, so basically no real change after a full year. That’s what’s stressing me out the most, because I expected at least some improvement.

Here are my recent labs:

* Albumin: 4.6 g/dL
* SHBG: 31 nmol/L
* Total testosterone: 428 ng/dL
* Free testosterone: 88 pg/mL
* Free T %: 2.06%
* Bioavailable testosterone: 51.5%

I really feel like I’m doing everything I know how to do. I sleep well, I train in the gym consistently, I eat clean, and I take ashwagandha, magnesium, and zinc. I’m around **15% body fat**.

I don’t have erection problems in general, I’m tall, developed normally, and I don’t have any major health issues. But sometimes I feel **tired**, my motivation isn’t always great, and I feel like I **don’t build muscle as easily as I should**, even though I train hard. The other thing that bothers me is that I **don’t get morning wood very often**, which just makes me overthink everything.

Because of all this, I keep thinking that **testosterone might be the reason I don’t feel 100% well**, but I honestly don’t even know if that makes sense or not.

What scares me is that I really **have no idea what’s holding my levels back**. It could be something obvious that I’m completely missing, or something hormonal/medical that I don’t even know to check for.

What can I do now?

I honestly don’t even know **who to ask anymore**, so that’s why I’m posting here. If anyone has been through something similar or has any idea what could be going on, I’d really appreciate the help. I’m pretty lost and worried about all of this.

I’ve been working with my psychiatrist for almost two years now to be stable med-wise (now lamotrigine) and mood-wise. Some days I really do wonder if the dx is real but I stay on my medication because it helps me. I honestly think it saved my life.

Enter my new bf who is an incoming third year medical student. I’ve fallen head over heels for him and opened up about the diagnosis due to the sexual side effects I experience from the medication. I even voiced my doubts and frustration. And to my surprise, he agreed with my doubts completely. He thinks that I don’t demonstrate bipolar symptoms and am too high-functioning to require a mood-stabilizer. He suggested a slowish taper off of lamotrigine, and if I get depressed, just starting an antidepressant with my PCP. 

I feel conflicted. My bf certainly knows me more personally than my psychiatrist. I know he isn’t my doctor, but he is going to an incredible school and is really bright. I’ve started a slow taper to see what happens. Is this stupid?

As the days have gone on it’s gotten worse and I’ve realised pressure/squeezing my areola causes the pain to become much worse and so I have to make sure I don’t lean my arm on it or lay on my stomach. It’s not exactly painful it just feels like a bee or wasp is stinging me.  There is no visual change and I can’t feel a lump although I’m a little wary feeling around as it feels like there’s a stinging nettle in there or something. 

I’ve had breast pain before which is hormonal but that’s symmetrical and tender, this is different and pretty horrible.

Pathomorphological Diagnosis Result

ICD-O-3: 8574/3 Adenocarcinoma admixed with neuroendocrine carcinoma
ICD-10: C61 Malignant neoplasm of the prostate

FINAL RESULT: Grade group 5 (Gleason Score 4 + 5 = 9) for acinar adenocarcinoma; areas with neuroendocrine differentiation were excluded from the Gleason grade assessment (WHO 5th edition). The carcinoma tissue occupies 41–50% of the entire prostate.

pT3a (tumor extends beyond the prostate)

N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)

No positive surgical margins &gt;2 mm detected

LVI1 (lymphovascular invasion present)

PNI1 (perineural invasion present)

EPE1 (extraprostatic extension present)

SVI0 (seminal vesicle invasion absent)

According to AJCC 8th edition.

Adenocarcinoma with Neuroendocrine Differentiation [Mixed Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NECs)]

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with partial neuroendocrine differentiation (WHO 5th edition).

Grade group 5 (Gleason Score 4 + 5 = 9) for acinar adenocarcinoma; areas with neuroendocrine differentiation were excluded from Gleason grade assessment.

Previous treatment: No information provided.
(If treatment had been administered, the tumor would meet criteria for treatment-related neuroendocrine prostatic carcinoma [t-NEPC]).

The predominant pattern is poorly differentiated (neuroendocrine carcinoma).

Neuroendocrine areas are mostly small cell carcinoma, with small foci of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Other Histological Findings:

Cribriform/glomeruloid pattern: present

Intraductal carcinoma: present

Tumor occupies 41–50% of the prostate

Multifocal tumor

Extraprostatic Extension (EPE): present, more than focal
Seminal vesicle involvement: absent
Bladder neck involvement: absent
Angioinvasion (vascular invasion): present
Perineural invasion (neuroinvasion): present, including involvement of autonomic ganglia

Surgical Margins: Carcinoma (Gleason 5) at surgical margins, all within EPE:

Apex, left side: 1.5 mm and 1 mm

Mid-section, left side: 1.6 mm and 1 mm

Mid-section, right side: 0.8 mm

Remaining prostate tissue shows atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC):

Synaptophysin: +/-

Chromogranin: -/+

AMACR: +/-

CKHMW: -

p63: -

Staging: pT3a according to AJCC 8th edition

His urologic oncologist checked his PSA levels after a few weeks post surgery which came back 0.08. My uncle got told that he is virtually cured of his cancer - everything was removed and his PSA is low.

My uncle also had an MRI of the pelvis which showed a solid focal lesion measuring 53 mm × 59 mm, located on the left side of the internal iliac fossa and in the mesorectum, displacing the rectum – neoplastic lesion. The oncologist said this is not connected to the prostate cancer and to consult with a GI doctor.

I'm very worried, I'm reading online that this type of prostate cancer NEC is very aggressive and the standard treatment is platinum chemotherapy. Yet my uncle is being told he's cured.

Could an oncologist or a urologist share their thoughts on what our next steps should be? Is our doctor correct?

The nurse at my local doctor’s clinic said that another southern hemisphere flu shot now (2 weeks prior to departure) isn’t needed as (1) I had influenza 6 months ago so my immunity would be decent, and (2) the southern hemisphere shot won’t be helpful for northern hemisphere strains and we don’t have the northern hemisphere shot here. 

I wanted to know whether another southern hemisphere flu shot would still help me heading into European winter, noting I had flu B 6 months ago. Would a boost of antibodies help a bit, or was the nurse right and there really is no point? I imagine wouldn’t be much point getting a northern hemisphere shot when we arrive as we are only there for 2.5 weeks.

So I often feel hungry even after my partner is done eating, and was feeling so guilty about it. 

But watching what he was eating all day, and him actually tracking his calories, he seriously does only eat like 2000kcal everyday. He’s 6’5 and very average stature (not overly thin or fat just… average) and I just don’t get how his body is functioning on that little food!? He’s semi active as well, hiking on weekends and doing yoga in the week.

I have the option to go with medicine (such as Wegovy) or a sleeve. The Dr said my BMI is right at 35 so he would support whatever way I decide. 


I'm trying to weigh the best choice for me. (According to the doctor) Medicine will work for one to two years then most people see weight creep back on -- and it'll likely give me a 20-30 pound loss. Surgery has risks but it'll be more successful long-term. I'm hoping to lose 70-80 pounds. 


My concerns with surgery, though, are:


• What my down time would be? I have 3 kids so it'll be difficult to not be able to do much or drive. I was told I'd need help for 2 or 3 days but I'm not sure if that's realistic


• How is your diet afterwards? I can't remember exactly what I was told as far as length of time, but he said a liquid diet at first and then mainly protein after that. Someone I know who has had this done told me they aren't supposed to eat any junk food or carbonated beverages ever again or else they will vomit. Is that true? 


My husband doesn't really want me to have surgery. He said I should just try harder to lose weight, so that's making me second guess myself.

I was 170lbs, 5'7 and my doctor's office labeled me as overweight even though I had gained a bunch of muscle frim kickboxing and looked great but I took it personally and went on a 3 month highly restrictive diet. Of course, I lost a bunch of weight (mostly muscle) and then started gaining until I reached 230ish lbs.

I have been dieting and exercising on and off without success (I swear I tried almost everything out there), and I finally got diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I was put on metformin and started losing weight and eventually got pregnant.

Well, I'm now 18 months postpartum and I started metformin about 6 months ago. I have been eating well and exercising and I've lost 25 lbs so far over 5 months, which is perfect and exactly the rate I wanted to go in. I'm now 207lbs, 2 pant sizes down and even though I have ways to go I feel amazing because I know I got this.

My husband has been fairly supportive through all this except he doesnt believe me when I say I've made progress. He's taking all the years that nothing worked and applying it to right now. I've made comments that basically every single person close to me has complimented me on my weight loss except for him. I tried to ask him to look at the scale when I step on it if he doesn't believe me or that I can put on my pants that fit me perfect 6 months ago and that now can't even stay on. But he just rolls his eyes.

I know I can just ignore him but this is driving me nuts. I think its mostly because we live far away from family so he's my only true support person here. He said he sees me every day so if he's not noticing a change then I'm overexaggeraitng. Which I think is the opposite because I never notice how much my twin toddlers have grown until someone from the outside makes a comment cause I'm with them all the time.

Sorry for the long rant, I've just been through such a long mental struggle with weight loss, this is draining me. Part of me is proud of how far I've come as I've never lost as many as 25lbs but part of me is sad and disappointed.",,,,2025-12-04 18:00:36.633203+00,8,0,null,en,3,2025-12-04 15:57:38,21283,6,,,"[""dietary_modification""]","[""stress"",""frustration""]","[""metformin""]","[""PCOS""]",[],"[""PCOS diagnosis"",""weight loss progress"",""metformin treatment"",""mental struggle with weight loss"",""supportive spouse""]",not_relevant,0.85,Post discusses weight loss challenges related to PCOS and emotional support without bariatric or PBH context,unknown,0.5,"[""Diet"",""Symptoms"",""Conditions/Diagnosis"",""Treatments""]",mixed,,"[""frustration"",""sadness"",""pride""]","[""sharing_experience"",""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_dietary_modification_035"",""symptoms_stress_XXX"",""symptoms_frustration_XXX"",""conditions_PCOS_XXX"",""treatments_metformin_XXX""]",,1764863858,,,

When my emotions go off, my whole routine falls apart. I managed to lose 12 pounds over the last 2.5 months, and then I gained 4 back in like 2 weeks. It’s honestly messing with my head.

I really want to get healthier and feel strong again. I want better stamina, better posture, and yeah, I also want to look good in clothes I actually like. My goal is to lose around 40–50 lbs in the next four months before summer. That’s roughly 2.5–3 lbs a week, which I know is pretty intense, but part of me feels like it’s still possible. I have seen it happen with people around me.

I do have a gym membership, but my gym anxiety is brutal. I either don’t go or end up doing the same two-three things every time, leg press, cycling and incline treadmill. At home, I’ve got one single 5 lb weight kettle(?) and a yoga mat. I work 9–5, take public transit, and since I’m in Canada and it’s freezing, I’ve been ordering groceries online (and crying at the prices). So I am also on a budget when it comes to groceries and I get tired of eating the same thing over and over but I know weight loss is not easy and I need to push through it 🥲

I drink coffee with lactose-free milk in the mornings. I’m low in iron and a bunch of vitamins, but I just started taking supplements my doctor approved.

I guess I’m looking for advice from people who’ve been through something similar or not idk. If you have lost weight with PCOS or emotional setbacks? How do you stay consistent? What actually helped? I just want to get back on track and not spiral again.

I had two losses in total after enduring the whole IVF process this year. This last pregnancy took a toll on me as I was so happy about it I was eating a lot of food and snacks, both healthy and unhealthy, resulting in me gaining over 10 pounds. I was already not happy with my weight before the pregnancy, so there’s that. 

After the loss and the medical condition that came with it, I am not cleared to start working out. I started my calorie deficit on Monday. I don’t eat anything before 12 on most days, however I do have a coffee with a splash of milk and sugar. I will say I cannot drink coffee black. I just can’t. It’s the only happiness I look forward to every day after what I’ve been through, so please understand this. 

I did start my first period since the loss, and noticed that my weight fluctuates higher in the morning than before by 1-2 pounds. It’s been disheartening, however I’m realistic when it comes to it all as I just had a loss and my hormones are all over the place.  I eat a lot more protein in my breakfast and lunch to the point where I am not even hungry for a full dinner, resulting in me being able to stay under and within my calorie deficit. I have also started yoga Pilates and walking on my treadmill. I’ve been very stressed because my dog suddenly got extremely sick as well and has been emotionally and financially draining me. 

All in all, I know the stress, anxiety and depression is contributing to my weight management, but are there any other tips for what I can do moving forward? anyone who just gave birth (normal or not) that can help me out with this?

I’m wondering if it’s normal to feel like there isn’t enough time during specialist appointments to explain all your symptoms. I often go in intending to give a full picture, but when the appointment starts, it feels like the doctor is trying to move things along quickly, and I end up leaving out details because I don’t want to slow things down or interrupt the flow. I recently had a GI appointment and left feeling like I wasn’t able to share everything that seemed relevant, especially details about my bowel movements and pain patterns. I had planned to discuss them, but the appointment moved quickly and I felt like there wasn’t a natural moment to bring up certain specifics. By the end, I felt like the doctor didn’t get the full picture of what’s been going on.
The visit was billed as a 45-minute moderate-complexity appointment, but it didn’t really feel like there was time to go into the level of detail I thought was important. I don’t think the doctor was brushing me off — I’m already scheduled for a scope — but I’m concerned that missing information might affect how we approach the issue.
My question isn’t about diagnosing anything. I just want to understand if this is a common experience and what I can do to get all of my concerns heard next time.

So we had to drive two hours to the metro area for this follow up appointment. After waiting for the appointment for about a month we finally are able to drive all the way there just for the doctor to walk in the room, look at the toe, and say “it doesn’t seem to be bothering him. f it’s not bothering him, we’re just gonna leave it alone.” Not once did he even touch my son. Didn’t see if touching the spot would get a reaction. I’m sorry sir, what? He has something that is not supposed to be in his body, in his body. What do you mean you don’t want to remove it?

For the last two weeks I’ve had a bit of soreness surrounding my right breast. At first I thought it was just from my bras so I switched back to using loose sports bras. This morning though, I felt what might be a small lump and when palpated, it’s a bit uncomfortable. It isn’t like a 10/10 pain by any means, but it’s more like if you pushed on an angry pimple. 

I have small breasts with fairly dense breast tissue, so it’s really hard for me to tell if this is actually a lump by itself or just a branch of my normal very hard/rough tissue. The spot I’m feeling just feels a bit.. not like the normal to me but is maybe the size of my thumbnail. I do have some nerve damage to my hands, so I have a bit less sensation than the average person, which is what makes it difficult for me to fully tell. 

I know cysts are more common than tumors, especially with an unknown history of cancer in the family (our family just never really spoke about those things so unfortunately I don’t know much of the medical history). How long do cysts usually last and at what point should I go to someone for this?

I do about 30 minutes of cardio per day (in addition to my weight training)

The event: I was offered a gig at a naked club in exactly 7 days! Short notice... no pun intended.

Anyway, I've never really been a dieting kind of guy. I just resumed working out 3 years ago after taking most of my 30s off. And, tbh, it was easy to be lean when I was in my 20s lmao.

I know its very very unlikely I'll get to a reasonable weight/bmi in a week. BUT, I would like any tips to get to my best body by the time the show comes (safely, but aggressively!!)

About my diet: I saw a nutritionist a month ago. He told me to get about 270 gram of protein per day (which I'm failing to do. I just can't eat that much!). What a normal weekday looks like now that I talked to this guy: 

* protein shake in the morning (350 calories), post-workout (250 calories), and post-post workout (350 calories)

* apple and peanut butter for breakfast

* meat and veggies for lunch (varies based on what the cafeteria has, but its always lean meat and some sort of veggie)

* two full calorie energy drinks (replacing with just one zero calorie pre-workout drink for the next week, saving 400 calories per day). Bubbly drinks are my weakness and the only ""cheating"" i do during the week.

* I drink 3-4 quarts of water though out the day

* weekends are sloppy... so I will definitely be strict this weekend lol

Again, I know its a very very short window and there is a lot of work to be done. I'm not looking to lose 45 pounds lmao. I'm just trying to make sure I drop all whatever fat and water I can.

I am a 26 year old woman, 149 cm tall, (4'11) and recently ""ballooned"" to a weight of almost 60 (132 pounds) kilograms within 4 to 5 months, after starting a new endometriosis medication.

For most of my life, I was either normal-sized or more on the thin side. The lowest I weight as an adult was 42 kilograms (93 pounds). I also struggled with ARFID (an ED that causes sensitivity to smell, tastes and textures) for most of my childhood and adolesence, which severly limited the amount of foods I could eat and ate.

Over the last couple of years, I slowly found a way to lessen my ARFID symptoms. During that time, I started doing sports again and ate regular meals (e.g. 3 meals a day), and eventually reached a fluctuating weight of 52 - 54 kilograms, which I was okay with. 

But now that I gained so much weight in such a short amount of time, I cant help to wonder if its due to my meds. I dont feel like I changed my diet or amount of activity a lot, certainly not enough to cause this amount of quick weight gain. 

I rarely eat breakfast and if so, only eat some jogurt or a piece of bread with cold cuts. Most of the times I skip breakfast because I just dont have much of an appetite. I usually only drink some coffee with milk and a coffee spoon of sugar.

For lunch I usually eat home-cooked meals that I prepared together with my grandmother. I think those are relatively balanced and can range from calorically dense foods like noodles in cheese sauce to less caloric foods like steamed greens and lean meat. 

For dinner I usually eat leftovers of lunch or some more bread with cold cuts, cheeses and vegetables and fruits. Sometimes I drink smoothies I made myself, made from a combination of fruit, vegetables and water. I add no sugar or sweeteners.

I also like to snack, but ever since managing my ARFID symptoms better I try to limit my snacking to one sweet per day, like a small piece of pie or a protein bar. There's days where I dont consume sweets at all, but there's also days were I end up eating two or three, especially now that its Christmas season and everyone is baking. I rarely eat chips and if so, pretty much only eat seaweed chips.

I exercise more or less regularly, including yoga, pilates, strength training and jogging. Theres times I train every single day and times where I don't do anything for a week, because Im terrible at building habits.

I already made an appointment with my doctor to check if my weight gain is really medicine based or not. It at least is a very common symptom of it. What do you guys think? Could this be natural weight gain due to eating wrong? 

If its due to my meds, does anyone have advice on how to counteract that? I'm really not comfortable with the way I look now, especially comparing myself to how I used to look. I dont feel like myself anymore. At this point I'm considering going off the meds if its because of them.

Thanks for anyone who takes the time to read and reply, Id appreciate any ideas and imput!

I eat the same amount of breakfast, it is not a surprise that high protein foods keep you full longer. However I have been avoiding eating animal meat (I’m a flexitarian) and usually have dinners with legumes. I decided to experiment with increasing my fish intake, especially by including it in my breakfasts. 

I highly recommend it to people who struggle keeping their blood sugar levels high in a busy lifestyle and there is a lot to be done until the lunch break.

Unfortunately fish shouldn’t be consumed so often due to mercury content, however eating 3-4 times a week has not been problematic for me. 

Here is two of my favourite fish breakfasts:

Any canned fish in tomato sauce + a quick carrot salad with whatever is in the fridge (tomatoes, onions, cucumbers) 

Smoked salmon and boiled eggs topped with mayonnaise and dried dill! 

It is important to give yourself enough time to have a full breakfast. It really makes the whole difference, provides improved mood and energy levels throughout the day.

This year I have been trying to lose that weight, but it's been painfully slow. I'm about 178 right now, and all of that loss occured in July-August. Now I'm just sort of stuck at 178, even though I want to get down to 145 ideally. 

I barely eat anything. My daily food intake consists of: one clif bar, a handful of everything bagel seasoned cashews, an apple or banana, and whatever my dad makes for dinner, although I'll usually just have the veggies and a carb like rice. In terms of drinks I have several bottles of water a day with liquid IV electrolyte stuff, one or two cups of tea, and the occasional zero cal soda. So basically I am NOT eating a lot. 

I know that weight plateauing is a thing, but I feel like I should be seeing at least some sort of changes seeing as I am still in a deficit. And before anyone replies ""that means you're not in a deficit,"" don't even try it, I can promise you that I am.

It was crazy. I am chalking it up to bacteria overgrowth in my gi tract due to the stool sample results I received ( I have high strep, staph, and candida from the sample).

I hit a wall recently where trying to be ""healthy"" felt like three different jobs. I was using one app to track my lifts/cardio, another to track my macros, and a mental spreadsheet trying to remember what groceries were rotting in my fridge.

The friction of switching contexts was killing my mood and eventually my consistency. If I was rushing out of the gym, I’d procastinate to log the workout and mostly forget it. If I was tired after work, I’d order takeout because I didn't have the energy to figure out what I could cook from my left overs that fit my macros.

So, I’ve been building a ""Unified"" tracker to see if an app can handle the mental load for me. The goal was to make it work at the ""speed of thought"". I've had a great time with it, and it solved a lot of my friction points.

**Here is the workflow I built for myself:**

* **The ""One-Sentence"" Log:** I wanted to be able to just speak or text: *""I ran 5k and had a chicken bowl with extra avocado.""* The system parses the exercise to calculate the calorie burn *and* logs the meal's macros simultaneously. No menu diving.
* **The ""Can-Do"" Kitchen:** Instead of searching for recipes, it looks at my current digital inventory and my health goals (e.g., ""High Protein, Dairy-Free"") and tells me: *""You have chicken and peppers expiring. Make this stir-fry.""*
* **Smart Swaps:** If a recipe calls for something I don't have, it checks my inventory for a viable substitution instantly so I don't have to run to the store.
* **Photo Input:** I can take a photo of my recipt or groceries and it automatically adds them to my fridge.

A couple more but I guess the point I'm trying to make it to move away from ""tracking"" and toward ""managing"" in a way.

For those who have fallen off the tracking wagon before, was it the **logging effort** (typing everything in) or the **decision fatigue** (what to eat) that got you?

It really helped me to stay consistent with my diet, and I'm trying to solve problems people have with their current tracking systems and just put something better out there. I’d love to know if this solves your friction points too and what I might be missing if people are interested in getting it on their phones (for free ofc but you'll need to create your own API key from an LLM like chatgpt or something to use it (i use groq)).

I was diagnosed with pneumonia and a UTI on Monday night after being in the ER all day. I was kept overnight due to my blood oxygen being so low. I was in the hospital until Wednesday afternoon I had gotten around 3 hours of sleep during my stay but I felt my symptoms have improved a lot. I was put on fluids and oxygen for the whole time I was there as well as antibiotics. They did another walk to test my blood oxygen and I had felt a lot less out of breath and my blood oxygen remained above 90 meaning they could send me home. I went home and used my pulse oxygen machine and when I checked when I walked around it was around 83-89. I’ve been occasionally checking and it’s been ranging between 90-97 while lying down. Sometimes it goes to 81-84 which I almost don’t believe since that seems abnormally low. I called the hospital I stayed out and they told me that it was normal for pneumonia to have that and told me to rest. I can come back if I feel worse but I don’t think I feel worse just my pulse oxygen machine makes me feel more anxious because it reads low.

Then leveled up even more with two hours of vomiting digestive fluids that tasted like bile plus my dinner every 10 minutes.   It was the scariest, most painful acute experience I've ever had.

They did a CT scan at the ER, found nothing. They acted like I was making it all up. It was a horrible experience. I talked to my surgeon directly this morning and he sent me for an upper GI study and also found nothing.

The best they are coming up with is it's possibly an ulcer, and throwing meds at me.  I do not think for one second it's an ulcer.

Prior to this, I had an appointment with my surgeon and my dietician. I complained that I’d been having random bouts of nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness sometimes coupled with a rapid heartbeat. It didn’t seem to be triggered by any particular food. For example, I’d eat a nonfat Greek yogurt with 0 sugar one day and be fine. The next day I’d eat the same thing and be really sick afterwards. My stomach wasn’t tender to the touch or anything like that. They did an ultrasound, saw some small stones, and I had my gallbladder out. 

I’m still having these symptoms. At first I chalked it up to having my gallbladder out - maybe I’d just eaten too much fat or my body is just getting used to things without my gallbladder. But now it’s been 2 months and nothing has changed. My surgeon doesn’t seem overly concerned and says it’s due to having my gallbladder out and to “give it some time”.

But these symptoms are starting to severely affect my life. Some days I’m perfectly fine and live like normal. Other days, no matter what I eat, I’m sick after every meal and can barely get out of my recliner. I can eat the exact same things and it still happens. I’ve been keeping track of my symptoms and writing a detailed log and it doesn’t seem to have any rhyme or reason to it at all. There’s nothing I can do to prevent this from happening except to just not eat. Which I can’t really do. 

Has anyone else had this issue before? Google says it’s possible that a stone was left behind and could be blocking the biliary duct. That’s the only info I can seem to find about this.

I’m looking for advice about macro/cal intake for busy sports people. 
Late 2023 I had cancer and gained so much weight from steroid medication I got to around 135kg 33-37% BF, 88kg before chemo. FF, I’m sitting at around 95-96kg now at 22-23% BF. It’s been a long tough process but here we are. My issue now is Id like to get to around 13-15% BF. 
Here I have my weekly training program, I follow this religiously as it keeps me sane 🤣 
My macro/ cal intake is around 1800-2100 cal / 150-200g carbs, 200-250g protein , 50-70g fat. 
My issue now is I’ve been fluctuating between 95-97kg in the last 4 months. 

Here’s my weekly schedule:

Weekly Training Roster
Monday- AM:LB  power + Ballistic PM:Zone 2 off feet
Tuesday- AM: UB  power+ strength 
PM: Touch footy game ave 70mins/ Game cancelled = Speed session + con: Shuttle runs

I’m looking to hear from people who are getting close to their goal weight, because I’m really starting to struggle now that I’m almost there.

I started my journey at over 100 kg and I’ve lost a lot of weight already. But now that I’m less than 10 kg away from my goal, things are getting depressing. The scale used to go down steadily, and now it just keeps bouncing up and down. I’m still losing, but very slowly, about 2 kg per month, and it feels like I’ll never reach the finish line.

I’m definitely in a deficit. I eat around 1200 calories a day, I don’t have weekly cheat meals, and I walk a lot, usually 15,000 to 18,000 steps a day. I know what I'm doing but still, the scale barely moves. Everything has slowed down so much, and it’s getting really frustrating.

I'll keep going till I get there but I wish things didn't have to be so frustrating. 

I wanted to reach my goal before my graduation in July but I'm not sure anymore.

Is this normal? Has anyone else gone through this phase where the last few kilos feel like the hardest? How did you push through?

I usually have two meals a day, with a snack (a banana or almonds). The issue is, I'm not depriving myself, but I just don’t feel hungry anymore. Do you have any tips for managing this?

This whole thing takes place in Sweden.

On monday morning I (among many others in my town) slipped on ice and injured myself. I felt my right ankle fold under me and it hurt so bad I didn't even notice that I sliced up my palm when I fell as well (a 3 cm laceration in a v-shape). I thought for sure my ankle was broken, had to take a cab to the hospital because all ambulances were busy, and waited for approximately 5 hours for an x-ray. I was told everything looked normal and was sent home without a wrap or crutches, despite not being able to put weight on my foot without crying out in pain. It was also swollen on the outside to the point the ankle bone was completely hidden, and a large bruise between the bone and the heel. Luckily I had crutches at home, and a wheelchair at work that I use when my chronic pain flares up, so I could still get to work yesterday (tuesday).

After work, I lost my balance at home and instinctively put my injured foot down to steady myself, and felt something snap or crack inside, on the side of the swelling, and I thought for sure I hade broken it for real this time, but then I realised I didn't feel any additional pain.

I’m hoping to get some guidance because I’ve been dealing with ongoing symptoms that started after food poisoning and haven’t gone away.

Timeline &amp; Background
	•	Early November: I got food poisoning (diarrhea, stomach cramping, the usual).
	•	After 2–3 days the symptoms went away, so I thought I was fine.
	•	But within the next week or two, all these other issues started showing up.

A sonogram later showed I was very constipated, and doctors think that could be why I felt so much pressure in my chest — like everything was being pushed upward.

Current Symptoms

1. Stomach / Digestive problems
	•	Ongoing constipation
	•	Feeling like food sits in my stomach too long
	•	Chest/throat pressure
	•	Burning in my esophagus after eating
	•	Bloating, burping, and slow digestion
	•	Discomfort under ribs

2. Neck / throat sensations
	•	For months I had neck pain that felt like someone squeezing both sides
	•	Doctors said this could be acid reflux
	•	Smoking made this pain worse
	•	It’s mostly gone now but flares with acidic foods

3. Heart palpitations
	•	Around 4 noticeable palpitations this month
	•	One was a strong “drop” followed by two small beats while lying down
	•	Afterward I felt tired, off, and almost sleepy

4. Other symptoms
	•	Occasionally a brief strange feeling in the back of my head
	•	Fatigue, brain fog, feeling weird/off
	•	Anxiety only after symptoms (not constant)


Relevant Details
	•	Smoked weed daily for 5–6 years; quit 1 month ago
	•	Don’t drink, don’t smoke anything now
	•	ER and urgent care blood work all normal
	•	Prescribed Lactulose + MiraLAX
	•	Endoscopy is scheduled for February due to payment issues with original provider
	•	No known major medical history
( I’ve gone to the er about 2 times this year and they all say it’s due to anxiety but I literally don’t feel or have emotions of anxiety I’m not anxious )

My Main Questions for Doctors:
	1.	Could the food poisoning have triggered all of this?
I’m not sure if the food poisoning caused a huge disruption in my gut, or if I had some underlying issue I didn’t know about — and the food poisoning “set it off” or made everything worse.
Is it possible for food poisoning to trigger long-lasting digestive or systemic problems?
	2.	Can severe constipation explain chest pressure, reflux pain, neck tightness, and palpitations?
	3.	Are these palpitations concerning in someone my age? Or do they sound benign? Should I ask for a Holter monitor?
	4.	Can quitting weed (after years of daily use) cause palpitations, head sensations, or feeling “off” physically?
	5.	What tests should I ask my doctor for to rule out anything serious?
(Heart tests, GI tests, blood panels, etc.)
	6.	At what point should symptoms like these require an ER visit?

Almost everyday I’m experiencing some sort of discomfort or pain this is really getting to me I’m getting mentally exhausted trying to figure what’s wrong and scared this is my new reality that there could be something seriously wrong with me.

So, what I’ve noticed (recently) when having chicken (with a side?) is that 1-2 hours later after eating, my stomach starts to hurt and I have to use the restroom. Like, it’s those painful cramps with the diarrhea. And then I have to use the toilet AGAIN 2-3 hours later. And it had this foul smell like vomit. And these cramps hurt a LOT, like I’m trying to stop my body from trying to push the issue out.

I’m not sure if it’s me being lactose sensitive (as my dad is lactose intolerant while my mom isn’t) as I had mac n cheese with the chicken, or if it’s the meat overall. I already know I have an allergy to shrimp (doesn’t make me swell up, but it upsets my stomach to the point I can’t eat anything 5 minutes after having a piece)

If you want more details:

I rested for 2 weeks, went back to uni on the 15th day, on the third week i noticed persistent pain, ultrasound said it was a mild Inflamation and small hydrocele, got prescribed antibiotics for 10 days, and the inflammation resolved.

on about 5 weeks post op I noticed something grey on the incision area(I thought it was fully closed) and pulled it thinking it was dirt, then i noticed the opening, and freaked out, my doctor said its alright and it'll close on its own, however its been  months now, its still there.

It does not hurt on its own, though it tenses up when sneezing, it burns with friction, when irritated, wearing something tight or when stretching/uncomfortable positions.

my balls also hurt, slightly when i strain, sit somewhere uncomfortable, or wear something tight. though the oain usually goes away slowly when i change positions, or change my clothes.

 currently not doing much physical activity beside walking, though i usually rest a little when it starts to hurt.

is this normal recovery, or should I be worried?

Any advise?,"For info: I'm male, 27 years old. I broke my humerus in October 2023 during arm wrestling. It was a very stupid thing to do, and I was kind of talked into it, but I didn't think much about the possible outcome, let alone that my humerus could break while doing that. Well, I learned my lesson.

The operation was kind of okay. They inserted the intramedullary nail, and I woke up after everything was done. Unfortunately, they discovered that my hand and fingers didn't move due to a possible radial nerve palsy. I read that this is a possible occurrence after breaking the humerus. So the next day I had to undergo a second operation where they cut the backside of my arm in order to see if the nerve was intact. It was okay. They said they had just irritated the nerve a bit.

The recovery was absolutely painful. For roughly half a year I couldn't extend my arm because of tendon shortening, and it took a bit longer until my fingers and hand recovered from the nerve injury. Until then it just kept getting better.

A year after the occurrence I talked to my local surgeon and she said that the nail could be removed. However, that wasn't easy to arrange.

I broke my humerus in a city 300 km away from where I live, and due to complications during the operation, mainly the miscommunication about discharging me and the lack of care at the hospital, I didn't want to have the nail removal done at that particular hospital.

So I talked with three hospitals about a possible removal, and after a while one of them said that it would be possible and that they would like to schedule an appointment with me.

At the hospital we discussed my issues and my motivation regarding the nail removal. I was advised that it isn't really necessary to remove the nail unless I have problems with it, because an additional operation means trauma and a possible second nerve palsy.

I was okay with the risks and agreed to move things forward. I was told that I needed a CT in order to get an appointment for the operation and also the model numbers of the implants used in my surgery because they weren't described anywhere in my papers, not even in my operation report.

I had a lot of phone calls and emails with the hospital where I had my bone fixed, asking them to send me the exact implants they had used so that I could get them removed. In the end, a registered letter with a return receipt did the job. But it took literally three months or so. It was an absolute shitshow.

In the meantime I had an appointment for the CT and the findings said: possible pseudoarthrosis. I read it and was absolutely gutted as my surgeon had said that the X-rays looked fine. So I took the findings to the hospital that had agreed to the nail removal, but they needed the CT images, not just the written findings. So I had to make an additional appointment at the radiology practice to get the images. Apparently they couldn't send them via email or give me a CD. This process delayed everything by about a month.

After I got my images I went back to the hospital and they looked through them. They couldn't understand the diagnosis. Everything looked healthy and good, so they agreed to move forward with the operation and give me a date for it.

The operation was planned for yesterday (02.12) and I had the preliminary consultation with a surgeon and an anesthesiologist the day before. I had to go through dozens of papers about possible risks of the nail removal and the surgeon emphasized that a nerve palsy might be possible as well. However, they all seemed somewhat skeptical about my plan, which I understand after reading a lot about the risks.

The day of the operation. I needed to arrive at 10 am and my operation was planned for 7 pm. At 11 am I got a call from a surgeon asking if I was already at the hospital. I said I was. He asked for my location, picked me up and said that we needed to talk.

He said that the doctors had agreed the evening before to cancel my operation. Unfortunately he was not involved in the decision making process, but he asked me about the complications I had after my first operation. I told him about the nerve palsy and he said that this was likely the reason for cancelling the operation due to the risk of irreversible nerve damage. Mind you, this was the first time someone had spoken about irreversible nerve damage to me. Before that it was never communicated that clearly.

He said that I could still try to find someone else to remove it, but my best bet would be the hospital that did my initial operation because otherwise it would be hard to find a hospital willing to accept the risk. So I was sent home and I still feel helpless and really bad to be honest.

So now let me tell you why I wanted to have it removed.

My arm just feels overly stiff and unnatural. Day to day everything seems fine, however once sports or a lot of movement is involved I feel a lot of unpleasant tension in my humerus and pain in the shoulder area. In all honesty it isn't that bad of a pain, but it is noticeable and something I didn't plan on living with for the rest of my life. At night, when sleeping with my arm above my head, my shoulder lets me know that it is there, every single night. And after a day of physical work, for example lifting a lot of things, working on my car and similar tasks, I get a burning sensation all around my humerus after everything comes to rest. Maybe that isn't enough to justify the risks of a removal, which I completely understand. But is there something I can do about it? I feel like this isn't given any attention by the doctors because I am probably young. They just said that this is normal because the metal inside my bone isn't as flexible as my bone structure. They also encouraged me to do some sports, which in all honesty I haven't done at all because it's painful. Whether it's swimming or push ups. I just don't want to push through the pain. Or is it still the lack of muscle? I'm clueless.

The worst thing of all is that I postponed my three month internship following a practical exam for a new job for this operation. I am currently in a workplace where I am really stuck and not happy at all. And all of this is giving me a really bad time.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

 I’m confused about my husband’s condition and hope to get some clarity.

A few years ago he already had high blood pressure but refused medication. In October 2025, he had a severe dizziness attack — he couldn’t move, couldn’t open his eyes, and was vomiting. We called an ambulance and he was admitted to the emergency department for 2 days. He received vertigo medication and IV drips, but the dizziness didn’t fully improve.

After discharge, the ENT said his dizziness was caused by a vestibular problem, not high blood pressure. The dizziness medicine from ENT made his symptoms worse, so they told him to stop taking it.

At his GP follow-up, the doctor said he needed BP medicine. He first started Amlodipine, then they changed it to Losartan after blood and urine tests showed mild protein leakage. They said Losartan can help protect the kidneys.

He has been on Losartan for around 2 weeks now, but his blood pressure still goes up and down. He also continues to have headaches. No follow-up was scheduled for his vestibular issue.

My questions are:
– Is it normal for BP to be unstable in the first few weeks of Losartan?
– Why wasn’t he given another vestibular check?
– Can Losartan make BP higher or cause kidney problems?

The past month, November, I had neglected my health and ate quite haphazardly and insufficiently, and I have lost some weight again, and my period didn't come since October.

As I reflect, besides beating myself up over neglect, I have realized that I have not ever given myself enough time to fully recover, always hovering in that dangerous zone of eating lesser than my needs and being borderline underweight, with ups and downs and not enough protein or vitamin B, for 8 months. and I am incredibly afraid and have been obsessing over how I might have permanently damaged my brain, and curbed my intellectual potential.

Anyway, I'm a woman (19 years old) and I've had diabetes for 7 years and I've never been able to maintain a stable weight. I've been overweight since childhood and only got worse after the diagnosis, my doctor always complained about my weight and highlighted that IT WAS A PROBLEM, and now that I use contraception it's only gotten worse. The only time I was at the ""ideal"" weight was when I discovered diabetes and almost died, I went from 62kg to 50kg in a week, and I was around 50kg until I was 1 year after diagnosis, and everything went wrong during the pandemic, since then I've always fluctuated between 70 and 80kg, no more and no less.
 I did yoga for a while, I know it's not something that has a big impact, but I have an undiagnosed problem with my hip, as well as being a kind of therapy and being associated with a diet, but it only worked to make me more leggy (I'm naturally lame, being overweight only highlights this). Furthermore, I tried and managed to ""induce"" ketoacidosis a few times to lose weight quickly, it worked but it wasn't worth it, I was left with a pale complexion, insatiable hunger and mortal thirst, in addition to absurdly high blood sugar levels. I did this stupid thing for events where I wanted to look beautiful, but I risked my life to do so.
 Finally, I wanted to say that it's just a rant, it's great to find a community that suffers from the same problem, I read some posts and I imagine that most people here are from the USA.

It is happening to me in the middle of the night - I wake up in a sweat. It has also happened when I try to take my daily walk and was stranded away from home. It is making me a shut in because I'm afraid I'll be somewhere and have an episode where I am not in control and likely faint. It is making me feel unsafe in my home, because if I fall, I'm likely to hit something on the way down. (I'm a senior citizen that lives alone). It is happening to me without a carb load and I eat very healthy.

* My Dr. has tried to preauthorize and Medicare turned it down.
* We tried to submit as Durable Medical Equipment and was turned down, again Medicare said no.
* Abbott Labs will give any John Doe a coupon to help with the cost but when I called them, they would not give me a coupon because I had Medicare. I don't think i should pay for this and I can't, anyway.

What kind of receipts do I need??!!?

* Would it be better to simply document my blood sugar when it drops?  (Taken daily and recorded in Contour App). 
* Would it be better to go ahead and simply faint instead of sitting down on the spot? (How do I prove this?)
* Would it be better to simply hit the emergency room every time I faint or near faint?

I just want some clarity going forward, I have no intention of making a complaint. I just feel increasingly uneasy and manipulated.

I've known my doctor for almost 20 years, he's always been weird but genuinely never thought he saw me ""that way"". Kind of thought he was autistic. He does my pap tests (he asked) so if I thought that I wouldn't have the kind of trust I've had in him. It's just things have gotten weird.

Basically, there was a 5cm mass in my boob so he had to see my boobs two months ago. Ngl they are pretty nice. But he stopped in his tracks. They aren't *that* nice. I tried to lighten the mood but he just kept apologizing for having to touch me. This guy does not ever apologize, like ever. But obviously I told him I understood since I had done the same thing the last three days. I chalked it up to the situation being inherently weird. Afterwards when I had my shirt back on, he got very agitated about me having cancer. Even that I might have bone cancer (long term leg pain) and he just without warning lifted my skirt above my hips, bent over me and then just stopped again in his tracks and apologized while staring at my legs. I think I said it was ok and then he lied me down, then told me to sit up but then immediately pushed me back down and said he forgot to check the glands, hands up skirt around hips. He felt manic to me which I assumed was stress.

He called me a few days later saying my boob didn't have cancer but to go to ER to get a leg scan and he'd write me a note. He was really insistent even tho I didn't understand why at all this was an emergency vs just waiting to get a scan. But he was very insistent on phone and call lasted a while because I really didn't understand why he was asking me to go to ER if I didn't have breast cancer.

I saw him a month after that and he wanted me to bend this way and that to see if there was something wrong with my spine. I had two sweaters I had to remove so only had a thin tight shirt at that point and when I was bent forward with him behind me he just pulled really hard on the shirt to get it out of my pants to  lift it up and touch my spine. No warning whatsoever. Then he wanted me to lie down and he took off my shoes and then told me my pants were too thick for him to check my reflexes. Ok I remove them, but then he wants to do a strength test. But it's me with no pants on my back, one leg bent and him over me pushing hard on it. It hurt intensely but also I was so confused and just wanted it to stop. At the end of the appointment he got mad at me because the ER had told me he had no business sending his patients there. I thought the whole thing was just very confusing. I just kept telling myself he's a weirdo but the thing is other than pap tests I've never taken my pants off in twenty years, he's never touched me without requesting permission before. But nothing completely unexplainable happened so I just assumed he was just weird and not apologizing was a good sign. 

Next appointment he's like this specialist needs to that, this specialist needs to do this, you need to go back to the ER. And I'm just like the specialists say you have to do this and that, not them, and you forget I worked in a hospital and what you're telling me is just not how things work and I know that for a fact. He did not like that at all. Like increasingly I find his behaviour erratic, incoherent, and saying demonstrably false things. I'm being asked to do unreasonable things like pass messages between doctors or go to the ER for no reason like a crazy person and when I push back he gets mad. 

Still I do what he says re: specialists (but not ER, I just can't help but feel manipulated since there's no reason to go). They redirect me to him so I inform his office that they all say he has to do the things, at which point his staff and my counselor inform me he has essentially said I need a psychiatric hold. I am not depressed or manic and have no history of anything like that. I am seeing a counselor because I'm on medical leave.

So that's the point where I'm at where I've made every excuse in the book for him that he's strange, he just has bad bedside manners, he's stressed, he's not well but it has nothing to do with me... But I've felt uneasy about the situation since he lifted my skirt. I can completely accept he may regret certain behaviors and I wouldn't hold it against him because he didn't really act on anything, but increasingly I feel really manipulated and like he's setting me up in some weird way to come across like a crazy person. Like I felt that way before it came to that last call, but since then I actually feel like I'm potentially being gaslit and that I would be very naive to keep having blinders on about his behaviour.

But I would prefer to ask doctors whether I'm just not reading this situation correctly. Especially since I'd have to deregister as his patient and go on a waiting list for years, so it's not as simple as just go finding a different doctor. I don't want to do this for nothing.

My erections are not as hard as the use to be and they are super inconsistent, I have no control over my ejaculations like one-two minutes and I’m there no build up or anything, and to make this worse I just got a new girlfriend and this is what I’m dealing with

I’ve never had these problems before I took a break from sex for 2 years, now that I’m active again I feel like it’s broken, idk if I should go see a medical professional or if I should wait it out

Detail: 

Erections inconsistent

Premature ejaculation

super weird sex drive (some days so incredibly high others it’s non existent)

I’ve taken viagra to help and it does but I don’t want to need it especially cause I’m so young I never needed it before

Extremely excited/anxiety when engaging, like I’m literally shaking sometimes

The pressure only happens sometimes. Not every time. It last maybe two minutes and goes away. I haven’t found anything that seems to trigger it.

She also ordered a STAT chest xray and we just did that, so we are waiting on the results.

My urine and stool colour have been normal for the most part, slightly dark urine more similar to dehydration. I am out of my home town for school so I am unable to see my doctor but on the phone she wanted me to get an abdominal ultra sound (it’s been very hard to get in).

Recently my eye won't stop twitching, so I was sent for another brain MRI and this did not show anything.

I have been diagnosed with HNPP, although the genetic test has come back negative (with only 80% accuracy), i am unsure if this is relevant here, probably not. My last neurologist appointment didn't go well and was told he won't continue investigating the issue and didn't appreciate being told that possibly his diagnosis was wrong or at least incomplete. 

So I guess I was hoping to know - where to next? Do I just need to accept that I have these symptoms or should I be getting another exam of some type?

For years I have been experiencing what seems like diabetes symptoms, but I am constantly assured that I in fact do not have diabetes, or even pre-diabetes.

However, I wake up anywhere from 1 (if I'm lucky) to maybe 6 times per night to pee. It's usually a full amount. If I don't get up to pee, I can't sleep. I also pee a lot during the day.

I go to bed at around 8 pm, and drink almost no water at all after around 3pm. When I wake up I usually feel pretty dehydrated, so I drink a lot of water in the mornings. For a while it was bad, and I was drinking more than 2 gallons of water a day. Now I take electrolytes and I'm probably closer to one.

I also get ravenouly hungry. There have been multiple times in my life where I've been fully convinced I had a tapeworm or something because I could just not stop eating.

I also get a lot of fatigue. And fatigue and hunger are usually worse after I eat. One of my darkest moments was when I ate lunch and had to put my head down on the table immediately after and started crying because it was the middle of the day but I was too tired to even sit up, i felt like i was literally starving to death, and wanted to go for a walk but was too tired. And I didn't even want coffee, all I could think of was more food.

I do rely a lot on caffeine though too. I can usually get by on 2 cups of coffee, but not less than that. I try to do one in the morning and one early afternoon, which usually allows me to stay up until around 8 or 9. Otherwise, I end up in bed before sunset.

I have no idea if any of these symptoms are actually connected. But either way, whats going on with me?

I’ve always had an extremely deep belly button. It doesn’t matter how much I weigh, Ive never seen the back of my belly button or reached the back with a q tip. My partner couldn’t even see all to the back. 

About 3 years ago my partner and I were talking about belly buttons and he tried to reach the back of my belly button with a q tip. It was very uncomfortable. After that it ended up having a foul smelling discharge for a week or so. Had a nurse friend look and she agreed that it was very deep and I should see a doctor in case of infection. Saw a doctor 3 weeks later, and by then it stopped having discharge and she told me not to stick anything in there anymore, no medication was prescribed. 

When I got pregnant I still never got to the back of my belly button. Last week my son poked my belly button a few times, just trying to mess with it as children do. 

I noticed today I have the foul smelling discharge back, and I cleaned it out. I tried to look inside with a flashlight and spreading it open, and I can see discharge pooling in the furthest back part I can see. It’s off white and watery and smells. 

Is it worth going to the doctor over or should I just keep it clean? It’s slightly red just on the folds, no heat just discharge. It didn’t seem like a big deal last time. Is it normal to have a belly button so deep? Is it normal for it to weep discharge if it’s messed with too much?

I was progressing steadily and watching my calory and macro instake very carefully and was going strong for about 9 months. Due to life events I took a break for about 8 weeks from the gym and did not watch my diet as well I should have. 

After this 8 week period I started going back to the gym and admitantly did not slowly ramp my way back but instead went right to my normal working weight after the break. I eventually noticed that after I released the weights on exersices that had my hands in a nuetral grip (for example hammer curles), I felt a sharp pain about half way up the outside of both of my forearms [right around here](https://imgur.com/a/nZaqsLH). But only ***after*** **releasing** the weights, but this applies for both dropping weights and tension being release, lifting something heavy onto my shoulder for example I will feel the pain during the ""pull"" motion.  I belive it should be noted that it is currently only occurring in my dominant (right) arm but the issue does present in ***both*** of my arms, its just currently on happening on my right arm.   
  
At first I could not tell the difference between this pain and regular DOMS/Burn but after a few weeks I noticed the pain outside of the gym and progressed even after I stopped going, presenting itself when lifting groceries onto the counter, or lifting a box of cat litter for example.   
  
I originally belived the pain to be ""in the bone"" but to be frank I cannot tell anymore nor do I think I can accurately describe what type of pain it is wether it be muscular, skeletal, or nerve pain as I have tried to explain it in depth to several medical proffesionals and I feel that I can never explain it correctly. 

At first I went to my primary care physician who told me to take Ibuprophin and rest for 6-8 weeks which I did, then after going back to the gym going low on the weight, and progressing slowly I went to move a seated bench which I suspect is 30-40 pound and felt a shooting pain in the same spot on my right forearm and it came back and took a few days to dissipate. 

I went to a sports injury doctor and he immediatly called it tendonitis and reffered me to occupational therapy who then, after performing several tests during an exam, diagnosed me with ""compressed ulnar nerves"".  I went to them twice a week for six weeks doing various exersizes and streches at home such as an ulnar nerve glide. After these six weeks they wanted me to start going back to the gym but with VERY light weight. So I did as such and used weight that was lighter than when I even first started going to the gym, but after 3 trips to the gym over a week the pain came back.   
  
This most recent flare up did have new symptoms that I would describe as nerve pain, shut as tenderness in my elbow channel but this was mostly seen in my left arm and not the one where the forarm pain is currently presenting. I personally feel that these are unrelated to my forearms but Im not a doctor so I cannot say so with any form of certainty, just that I have never experienced them prior to occupational therapy.  
  
I unfrotunately cannot afford to continue going to occupational therapy fopr an issue that I belive to not be a compressed ulnar nerve. I attempted to get a medical degree from google university but looking up my symptoms/issues there are people who describe exactly what I seem to be experiencing no where seems to have a concrete answer.   
  
I do not experience any form of pain in any of my joints when this happens, only the mentioned forearm pain. The pain will seemingly go away if I stop going to the gym and keep any amount of wieght on the lighter end but after staying home for 3 months for my most recent break the issue still came back in a week with what I would describe as a miniscule amount of weight.   
  
I cannot track any specific exorsize to have been causing this as I was doing my entire routine without any issues besides some hyperextension which was solved with being more mindful with my form prior to taking that initial 8 week break.   

I am 1500 dollars in the hole for therapy that did not work and I cannot afford the 140 per session to continue to try to fix this. I also do not want to just keep taking 8-12 week breaks to try to let this apparent never healing injury to heal.

I will do my best to answer any and all questions that are asked of me. I can also provide my workout routine as well if needed. The only medications I take are 2 instant release adderal twice a day and 5mg of Creatine per day when im activeley going to the gym

  
I just want to go back to the gym :/

They noticed my HGB was 7.1. A week later, I had a mini stroke &amp; ended up in hospital. They did a stool/fecal test &amp; found blood in my stool. They also gave me a blood transfusion. Since then, I have been going in, on average, every 2 weeks for a blood transfusion. I've had 3 sets of iron infusions (5 each set) &amp; without fail, my HGB still drops.

I've had 2 colonoscopies this year, 1 endoscopy, &amp; swallowed a pill cam. GI Dr did not find a reason why/where I'm bleeding. (He said I had non-bleeding internal &amp; external hemorroids)  
I have a CAT scan of my chest, abdomen, pelvic area in a couple of weeks to see if there are any masses or blockages (my blood pressure has been running over 200/100 when at Drs - I have resistant hypertension, but these numbers are higher than they've ever been. I take nifedipine, hydralazine, &amp; clonidine, lasix, glipizide, zinc, folic acid, vit D &amp; magnesium. My kidneys aren't working properly &amp; not sure if it's been from the severe anemia...I am not on dialysis. There has been talk of giving me a once a week shot (**PROCRIT)** to build up my red blood cells, although it's dangerous for people with high blood pressure. I am scared.

Just had a bone marrow biopsy, but Dr. hasn't called to explain results. It shows, ""Indicator: Leukemia"" and the results are all Normal/Negative.

Since Feb, I'd get a blood transfusion when my HGB was 7 or below. I was sent to ER when it was 5.6. Since July, I've been getting blood when my HGB is 8 or below &amp; I've been getting 2 bags of blood during transfusions. The Dr. is trying to get me to a HGB of 10, but it's only been as high as 9.6 &amp; within a week, dropped to 8.3.

My ferritin levels are always high because of the transfusions, so I get iron infusions, too.

I had a partial hysterectomy 20 years ago, so blood loss isn't from periods. (I still have my ovaries)

It's been almost a year, &amp; it's been nothing but appointments with so many different specialists, and numerous appts at the cancer center to get transfusions &amp; infusions.

Drs are stumped &amp; I'm just so tired &amp; feeling hopeless.

No other medications and no constipation. 

Very embarrassing. 

Spoke with my doctor who prescribed Scheriproct ointment (with Prednisolone) over the phone, saying to let them know if it doesn’t work. 

But I feel like I’m past that.

I really don't understand what this pressure is. Idk how to describe it. It's on the base of my right ring finger and it comes and goes and it's been like this since yesterday. 

It's like, the 2 ways I can explain it: when you have a blister and you push on it slightly and it creates a specific soft pressure, and when there's a thread that's straight and sturdy and you touch it and it creates a pressure on the area of the body you touched, kinda like that but not just a line of pressure but a bigger area. 

I've been having knee problems since I was 11, spread to the other knee at like idk 12 and to all my joints at 14 and I'm 17 now. Because of the rain and cold air, I've been having bad flare ups over the last few days and idk if this might just be a new symptom to add to my list. This and a really sharp on and off pain in my ankle that's so bad sometimes I'm close to tearing up, but it goes away within seconds to minutes so I don't wanna be overly dramatic. (I think it's a pinched nerve but who am I to say)

The doctor said it might either be osteoarthritis or post strep infection arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis but less chances. And that was before she saw the results of my blood tests other than the rheumatoid factor(normal) and ASLO (really REALLY high) (I never went back).

Hey Reddit Doctors-

I, f41, Ca, dx: Cvid-ish (precise diagnostic will be determined soon- my B cells are lazy so I get my immune system through IVIG)  

TLDR: I get monthly IVIG infusions at a county facility (dignity Santa Cruz) with a history of unprofessional behavior and poor protocol. Last week, a nurse casually told me she accidentally infused a patient’s iron into muscle instead of a vein, then laughed about it, shared inside jokes about it, blamed the patient, and didn’t inform her she hadn’t actually received her medication. This, plus ongoing safety issues, makes me question whether I should transfer and/or file a complaint (but to who?). Am I overreacting? I know you all are short staffed but this is the norm here.  I’m not trying to make waves, I just feel profoundly uncomfortable with it all. 

The post:

I receive monthly IVIG infusions at my local county facility, about two hours outside the Bay Area. Unfortunately, the infusion center here is subpar and unprofessional. The environment and culture amount the staff is unprofessional, and I’ve had repeated issues with staff not following basic medical protocol when administering my own medication. I’ve even been made fun of for requesting standard safety measures.

Because infusions are a routine part of my treatment, I’ve been encouraged to do them locally to avoid the long drive to the city.  The local place gives me the icks, and I recently had another example that again highlighted everything.  I think I want to change facilities.  I want to make a complaint but the culture is ingrained in this facility and I’m not sure who would listen to me or if this is all normal and I’m overreacting. Is it appropriate I just ask for a transfer to another facility? 

Here is what happened: 

While being plugged in last week for my infusion via a port the “best nurse” casually was chatting with me about her last patient the day before who had an iron infusion. 

She put the iv in and a few hours later when she went to detach it and send the patient on her way, she realized she put it into her muscle and let the entire thing drain.  My jaw was on the floor.  

She said the woman will likely have a new tattoo, and that she and the nurses made jokes she was overweight and didn’t notice the swelling and everyone is joking they now offer subq iron infusions.  I asked if she then had to get another infusion into her actual vein- nope they sent her on her way.  I asked if they told her of the potential side effects or that she didn’t actually have her infusion- nope not at all.  She made endless jokes about it all and said it was the woman’s fault for not speaking up (while joking about her weight and everything).

I felt a unique mix of emotions hearing the story about to be plugged in- horrified and terrified all the while I was up next.  ￼ we don’t know what to expect and as patients and we give blind trust to medical providers- how would this woman know to speak up? Who cares if she was overweight (I’m 90% sure the nurse said she was post partum but I wouldn’t care if she just ate a bunch of twinkies) Don’t we all have a right to human dignity and competent care at the very least?? 

I expect more from medical professionals and can’t belive I was told this story casually by the person who did it and when I questioned it in detail jokes were made the whole time.  I thought about complaining or saying something but half the nurses had no mask nor did the pharmacist (and we are under a mask mandate in a center that treats the most vulnerable) so at the time it would fall on ears to a culture that thought the whole thing was a joke (a couple of months ago the nurse called me a precious flower for asking her to follow the packet guidelines for the admin of my drugs) and I heard it first hand from the actual nurse and  I hoped that a colleague spoke up.  ￼I just prayed the whole time while I went through mine.  

I would like to know if I’m over reacting or if I’m reasonable to request a transfer to another facility at this point- and can I even make a complaint about this because it didn’t happen directly to me- I was told first hand by the nurse that did it and it has no effect on me-  and who would I make a complaint to when even the pharmacist doesn’t wear a mask and it’s all a subq joke to them all?

Im not trying to be a pain in anyone’s ass but somewhere out there in the Bay Area a woman is walking around without her medically necessary infusion, with a new arm tattoo and she has no clue-  and I get anxious about the whole thing especially how they’ve messed mine up in crazy ways before.  Is it reasonable I request the transfer of facilities? Am I overreacting? I just don’t feel safe and healthy getting treatment here. I’m not trying to start a fight with an infusion center or nurses- they just don’t make me feel medically safe at all.

Frustrated and desperate for the truth.","At my wit's end and not sure where to turn, any insight is appreciated.

My father \[66M\] is probably one of the unhealthiest people I have ever seen. Since I want to keep this as short as possible, here's the quick facts:

* **Height** \- \~5' 10""
* **Weight** \- \~180-190 lbs (not sure on this one)
* **Race** \- White
* **Existing medical issues/history** \- Trying to keep this brief, so I'll try to hit the high points. Major ones include: recent diagnosis of prostate cancer (diagnosed 11/28/25; I do not know the stage or specific type yet, more details below); had laryngeal cancer in 2013 and in remission since; chronic migraines; high blood pressure. Botched laparascopic apendectomy in Jan. 2022 resulting in abscess formation and sepsis, hospitalized for 3 weeks post-op as a result. Had osteomyelitis on his sternum (he is not an IV drug user) requiring removal of part of the bone in Feb 2024, suggested cause was decay due to radiation treatment from the earlier cancer.
* **Current Medications** \- Too many to list. Dailies include gabapentin and pregabalin for nerve pain, and multiple beta blockers/vasodilators for HBP (sorry I do not know for sure which medication, I think propranalol but not 100% on that). Takes probably 1,000mg or more a day of acetaminophen like they're Tic Tacs. He does not respect or follow dosage amounts of the prescriptions. Lastly, he semi-regularly takes \~15mg dextroamphetamine salt (not prescribed) maybe 3-4 times a week that he buys from a friend.
* **Other** \- Casual drinker, heavy smoker. Probably 1.5-2 packs a day. Almost completely sedentary lifestyle. Poor sleep schedule even before what's happening now.

Now, then, the **primary complaint**: beginning about 3 months ago, he has started to (randomly?) fall asleep during the day. Not only this, but he will fall asleep in the middle of actively doing something--so far I have heard of him falling asleep in the middle of conversations with clients, at dinners, in a 300-person seminar, and now most recently *while driving his car*. This is why I am reaching out to this sub, because my understanding is that he is past the age of a narcolepsy Dx. **I am so worried that he will get hurt or hurt someone else accidentally because of this.**

My biggest obstacle is, in fact, my father himself because...**he lies**. About pretty much everything, but especially about his health issues to me, and to his doctors. Everything I listed above about his history is from my own observations, research, or sometimes downright snooping through his stuff. I can't ask him what's going on with this 'falling asleep' symptom because he would not even admit that it's happening unless he falls asleep in front of me.

Part of me is suspicious that he is going through a mental crisis with the recent cancer diagnosis (he is, for example, seeing a lot of women on dates recently) and am concerned that this sudden ""narcolepsy"" is actually caused by staying up all night doing harder drugs. Besides the sleepiness, I haven't noticed any drug-use symptoms and I am familiar with how it may look as I've had many close friends in the past fall down that rabbit hole.

He's a nightmare patient and has left hospitals many, many times AMA. He does not follow prescription regimens or physician instructions/recommendations no matter how severe the consequences may be. It's incredibly frustrating to see him suffer but to also know that he does absolutely nothing to mitigate the situation. I can't outright ask him what this is about, because he wouldn't tell me even if he knew the reason. So--**any ideas about what may be causing this**? Have you heard of a patient that had sudden-onset narcolepsy at age 66?

I have started feeling like it is useless to go to urgent care for it because every time I go, they tell me that they do not detect any bacteria and that it is not a UTI, therefore, I should not take antibiotics for it. At my last urgent care visit for this a few months ago, they also did a full panel STD check which was also clear. It happens whether or not we use a condom. Perhaps it happens more often when sex is a bit more on the “rough” side. I do not have sex often as I am single, so when I do, the UTI thing happens.

Due to intense pain one day at the age of 12, there was some suspicion of an transient torsion of the appendix of the epididymis, but I do not recall if this was confirmed or on which testicle, as it was many years ago.

Another ultrasound for testicular pain in my 20s revealed a couple small epididymal cysts, on each side, in additional to small hydroceles + varicoceles.

Not sure if its at all relevant, but I am a new dad to a toddler - and have experienced a pretty sharp increase in heel kicks and blows to the testicles (lol).

A couple weeks ago I started having fluctuating pain in my left testicle (which has largely resolved), and mentioned this my PCP, who said my exam felt normal, but he would do an ultrasound just in case. I had this done, and it confirmed the prior findings, but additionally a finding near one of the small cysts - a ""4mm echogenic structure"", and recommended follow-up in 6 months. This has sort of sent me into a spiral of anxiety. My PCP says he's going to send me over to Urology ""to look everything over"", which will likely take some time. Meanwhile, this is causing me a lot of distress - and I was hoping to get a bit more perspective and real information about what this means?

    TECHNIQUE:
    Scrotal Ultrasound was performed including color Doppler interrogation.
    
    FINDINGS:
    The right testicle measures 4.8 x 2.3 x 3.3cm.
    The left testicle measures 4.4 x 2.1 x 3.3cm.
    The testicles demonstrate normal echotexture and color flow. No intra
    parenchymal mass or infiltrative process can be identified.
    
    There is a 2 mm simple appearing cyst of the right epididymal head. There is a
    simple appearing 3 mm left epididymal head cyst. There is an echogenic structure adjacent to the left-sided cyst measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. This demonstrates color Doppler, which could represent flow versus twinkle artifact.
    
    There are prominent pampiniform plexus vessels bilaterally, more prominent with
    Valsalva.
    
    Small bilateral hydroceles.
    
    IMPRESSION:
    Bilateral varicoceles. Small bilateral hydroceles.
    
    Tiny epididymal head cysts.
    
    Subcentimeter echogenic structure of the left epididymal head, potentially a
    calcification, of uncertain significance. Sonographic follow-up in 6 months
    recommended.
    
    Normal appearance of the testicles.

1. Is this a real threat of developing into something else? I've read a primary malignancy of the epididymis (any subset) is extremely rare, but I can't help me attach my anxiety to that fear a bit.
2. How common is the mentioned ""twinkle artifact"" with calcifications? This is honestly one of the more concerning parts of the notes to me.
3. Above all else, is this something I can just ""let go"" for now? Its just hard for me to gauge if this is something potentially serious I need to closely follow or be concerned about.

Any help would really mean so much! Ive also attached the limited shots I was able to take of the left testicle, but it was quickly on the way out.

No medications - just vitamins but have had to stop them for ten days before upcoming surgery 

Hello, I’m really trying to understand what may be going on with me physically right now. 

I have had three bouts of pancreatitis in the last two years and the last was in October. With it has also been some mystery stomach pain and inflammation. This last time the ER was short staffed, I was sent home early to manage but couldn’t. I vomitted the entire weekend and became dehydrated. I didn’t have a bowel movement for a week and became constipated. It was also excruciatingly painful and I began to feel sick from it.

The ER speculated it was an internal hemorrhoid and gave me laxatives and stool softeners. After a few weeks it started to slowly feel better then suddenly the pain came back and it was unbearable. I saw a colorectal surgeon who said I likely had a fissure that turned into an abscess and now formed a fistula.

This is all very new and overwhelming for me. I am scheduled for surgery this week. Last week it started to hurt bad again but then the next day went back down. It’s been up and down but now I’m starting to worry.

Is it likely I had another abscess? Or that I have an infection? I’m so worried about sepsis from what I’ve read in trying to understand this.

The last few days I’ve felt unwell, and run down, and a bit colder. I feel like when you start to get a cold and my muscles are sore and I keep getting itchy rashes on my neck. Also my lower stomach hurts and ears are ringing.

However, I’ve also been menstruating the last seven days, and my stomach has felt inflamed like it sometimes does. I do have tight muscles often but given everything that is happening and that I feel unwell I’m feeling anxious about having an infection or sepsis from this.

My blood pressure is normal, a little elevated actually (130/90 usually it’s around 125/85) and my pulse usually is low (high 50’s) and that is around the same. I don’t have a fever, I usually run around 97 or a little lower and it’s been between 96-97.4 give or take.

Any kind of insight is so appreciated. Does this sound normal and like I’ll be okay until surgery this week? Or could this be an infection or sepsis? I’m happy to provide more information. Thank you!

I am still extremely unwell, even though vomiting has stopped for 72 hours and I am seeking guidance from healthcare professionals who have experience managing CHS, particularly prolonged episodes.

Background / Cannabis Use:
	•	Heavy daily cannabis user for ~10 years (flower, carts, concentrates, edibles).
	•	Most recently: ~½ oz flower/week via bong, mixed with small amount of American Spirit tobacco.
	•	Episode began Nov 16; quit cannabis Nov 18. No tobacco since Nov 16.
	•	First ER-level CHS episode: 2021; about 1 per year since. This episode 100% confirmed CHS for me.

Timeline:
	•	Episode started: Nov 16
	•	Vomiting stopped: Nov 29 (3 days vomit-free)
	•	Last ER visit: Day 5 (managing at home since)
	•	IV rehydration: Days 1, 2, and 5
	•	Labs &amp; CBC on Day 11: Normal, slight elevations but nothing concerning to PCP

Current Symptoms:
	•	Persistent nausea
	•	Strong abdominal pain and spasms
	•	Diarrhea if anything passes (normally daily; no BM until day 8, 2 since)
	•	Intense thirst or lack of interest in drinking
	•	Temperature swings
	•	Jitters, anxiety, extreme mood swings
	•	Severely disrupted sleep: 3–5 hrs at a time, sometimes only once per day
	•	No appetite
	•	Fatigue and heightened sensitivity to noise, light, and textures
	•	Food tolerance extremely limited: only 4–6 bites/day for last 3 days

Current Intake:
	•	Fluids: water, Gatorade, broth
	•	Very small amounts of bland food (BRAT diet: toast, rice, banana), no dairy or cold foods

Treatments Tried:

Effective:
	•	Promethazine 25 mg rectal suppository: only anti-nausea medication that has helped; &gt;72 hrs vomit-free. Stopping it triggers return of nausea, tried today. Trauma makes administering it uncomfortable, but I will continue for at least 5 more days.
	•	Hot showers, rice sock, heating pad/blanket
	•	Lidocaine patches (abdomen) / Capsaicin cream (back)
	•	Ginger/peppermint tea, ginger lozenges
	•	Short walks
	•	Careful hydration in small sips

Ineffective:
	•	Other anti-nausea medications (Zofran, etc.)
	•	SeaBands
	•	ER care: no CHS-specific treatment, overstimulating, long wait times

Ongoing Issues Despite Vomiting Stopping:
	•	Nausea
	•	Abdominal spasms
	•	Diarrhea
	•	Sleep disruption
	•	Severe fatigue and inability to function normally
	•	Extremely low appetite

Questions for Medical Professionals:
	1.	How long does the post-vomiting but still severely symptomatic phase typically last in prolonged CHS episodes?
	2.	Are there strategies or medications to help with abdominal spasms, persistent nausea, appetite restoration, or sleep during this phase?
	3.	Are there any other interventions or supportive measures that I should consider while recovering at home?

I am actively seeking professional guidance, as I feel unsafe continuing at home with these symptoms alone.

27M, 

Symptoms: Heartburn, throat burning, indigestion, fatigue, nausea and feeling like pooping after eating, 

Stopped happening: heartburn, nausea/feeling like pooping, indigestion and, fatigue (have decreased greatly, but if overeat these two return for a bit)

Hey, everyone! About two months ago I went through some very stressful situations and as result of that, I had almost an entire week of very loose diet (eating greasy meals, cakes, drinking soda, etc). Then suddenly I feel heartburn, my throat starts to burn, I feel nauseous, indigestion, so naturally I think of reflux. I had very similar symptoms back in 2021 in very similar conditions due to the pandemic, had never heard of GERD (didn't know about it at that time), so when I found out about it I freaked out more, only thing that would calm the symptoms down a bit was omeprazole. Thankfully, I had an appointment with a psychiatrist and got prescribed antidepressants and after only a few days of taking them, the reflux was gone! I stopped taking omeprazole completely and then the meds maybe one year in, and the reflux never returned. Fast forward to last october. So, I think ""yeah, makes sense, after all that stress and bad dieting, it probably came back with a vengeance."", but one thing I didn't account for was that now i'd feel fatigue, mostly after eating something. I'd eat a sandwich, then maybe 20 minutes later i'd feel kinda tired. It wasn't debilitating, but it was enough to make me freak out even more. I get back on omeprazole for a few days, get another appointment with a psychiatrist, get the same medication, days go by and nausea, the fatigue and heartburn get slightly better, throat too. I take omeprazole for I think 6 days before stopping it because I thought it'd be similar to 2021's episode, and the antidepressants only would be enough. Unfortunately I hop back in bad dieting, and then the throat starts burning again. Just for a clarification, I had not seen a gastroenterologist yet, so I didn't know how to ""use"" omeprazole properly. Didn't see it as a treatment. So I choose to resume using them until i'm completely healed. A few days later i'm feeling better, the fatigue returned only for three days but then it stopped so I thought it maybe was a side effect of omeprazole and i'm left only with the throat irritation, no heartburn at all. But then, at the gym (the only good thing of all of this is start I finally returned to the gym after more than a year hiatus) I see some people coughing. Don't think much of it, but lo and behold the next day before sleep I feel that characteristic body ache, fever, my throat was not burning anymore but it was so sore that it made me unable to sleep until maybe 5 am when I finally had enough and googled how to decrease sore throat from the flu. I wasn't taking any other throat medication to help with the soreness cause I thought that it could mess my stomach since I was recovering from the reflux crisis, but again, it was more of an anxiety driven decision. I discover that honey with warm water help, and it did! At least enough for me to finally sleep. The worst part is, before the flu symptoms finally kicked in, for the first time in a while I was not feeling anything in my throat. No irritation and burning, only a mild ""hotness"" coming out of it. Anyway, sore throat takes like two days to get better. Let's say I got the first flu symptoms on a monday, got better around wednesday, thursday was fine, but then friday I have my breakfast before going to the gym and a few minutes later I feel nauseous and feeling like pooping. That had never happened before, but maybe it was another side effect of the flu plus the omeprazole. Saturday, I order milkshake. Big damn mistake if you ask me. Immediately after I feel my stomach complaining a lot, bloated, it takes hours for digestion to finally occour. But it eventually does, I go to sleep with not much issue. The next morning after eating breakfast  (a whole bread egg sandwich), I feel so nauseous and sick, fatigated, and basically I go the morning and evening like that. Next day, same thing, always after eating something. Get scared enough and finally have an appointment with a gastroenterologist. Fortunately by the day of my appointment the nausea/feeling like pooping and fatigue had stopped, I had eaten just fine without feeling sick. So I go there, tell them what I was going through (mainly focusing on the throat burn/flu reaction and the fact that I was a bit afraid of just stop taking omeprazole abruptly and causing some rebound), they prescribe me voquezna and a few probiotics. I also tell them my fear of GERD and having to deal with it my entire life and they say it's unlikely because of my symptoms (I never had hoarse voice, coughing, acid taste in mouth, etc), but for us to really be certain I should have an endoscopy. I tell them that i'm not much of a fan of the whole procedure and that i'd rather not (in other words, I was scared as hell of having to go through that), they say that if i'd like, we could discuss having it after or next appointment if I did not get better by then. So, that was two weeks ago. What i'm going through right now is trigger food based I assume? i had pizza, felt nothing other than a slight increase in the throat irritarion. Went to a birthday party in the weekend, had two slices of cake, then my throat felt very irritated for the rest of the day, the next day it was better (although it still feels irritated), but I had fatigue for maybe 15 minutes after eating breakfast. Back then, at the peak of ""burning throat sensation"", i'd drink water all the time, but now it is not as potent, so i'm not very dependent on that!

Some additional information: I never puked due to nausea, I never had diarrhea, never had any sharp pain in my stomach, didn't drop huges amounts of weight (i'm losing a healthy amount each week due to going to the gym from monday to friday and overall eating way better than I was before all this), no head fogs. Also, I can lay down just fine without an elevated pillow, I wake up feeling well until the  throat irritation begins maybe a few minutes after.

After sitting for some time and then standing up, she’s experienced total loss of feeling on one side of her body. It’s not exactly the same every time: sometimes it’s just her leg and arm, one time it was all the way up to her face. The numbness lasts about 10-15 minutes before she returns to normal. At first I thought it may be connected to her sitting with her legs crossed, as 2 of the times it occurred was after she was sitting that way.

This has happened four times in the past couple years, so not terribly often, but it worries me a lot nonetheless. I’d like her to see a doctor about it but she hasn’t yet. My fear is she’s been having mini strokes.

Other people probably will maybe, but I know what I'll look like under my clothes with the loose skin. 

It's not for relationships. Women and sex intimidate me, and I'm too scared to be fully honest and vulnerable with another person. Plus I'm not too keen on being hurt or abandoned again. 

It's not for health. Maybe when my weight hurts me enough or becomes more of enough of an inconvenience this will change, but it's not much of a concern right now. 

It's not for confidence. Feeling pride in myself or my accomplishments is an alien concept. If I lose the weight I'll only look back and fault myself for not doing it sooner. 

I really only have shame as a motivator, which explains why I have such trouble losing weight. If shame actually worked no one would be fat. But for short bursts it's fine I guess. 

Also a bit of spite. I want to lose the 240 lbs and then when people say that I must feel so much more confident and that I look great I can tell them I still hate myself, that nothing really changed and I'm still a fat guy in my head because that's who I've always been. 

Basically, I want to succeed so they can see how miserable I am. Never said I was rational. 

And I know. Therapy. I've done a bit and learned things that help, I just gotta find a good reason to use them.

On Wednesday, I had to eat out for 2 meals due to driving and so had around my maintenance calories (1900ish).

Choose one small ""resolution"" that you can consistently work on for 4 weeks. You don't have to be perfect at it every day. You just have to be consistent with it! Once you get the hang of it, you can add on another, then another, then another and so on.

You stack these new habits one after another, and then boom! it's mid february and you're much futher ahead than you would have been if you tried to start everything day 1 of 2026.

Since those five days I’ve been doing 10k steps a day and eating only 3 small meals and 1 snack (like an actimel yogurt) a day.   


i really want to know if it is even POSSIBLE to gain 2kg in 5 days, or if my scale is acting up, but I know it isn’t because my stomach just looks fatter overall. I really have no clue what I’m doing wrong. I stick to low calorie foods, sometimes I just straight up make vegetable sauce and eat that without carbs like pasta or potatoes, which I used to do. 

Is it possible go gain weight in 5 days, and why am I still fat and/or losing weight very slowly.. I started in October.

I recently lost 20 pounds 2 months ago. I went from 138 to 118 pounds. My calorie deficit got to be too small as I started losing more weight, it went from 1600cal per day to 1200cal and I was miserable. My hair and nails were thinning and I had no energy. So I decided to start weightlifting so I could burn more calories and fit in enough calories into my deficit. I currently eat 1486 most days but 1186 on sundays and mondays because I don’t work those days and burn less calories.  

I’ve been weightlifting for 2 months now (mon-fri weekly) and I’ve been aiming for 100-130g of protein. I have seen muscle growth but I haven’t leaned down at all. I know I have to be patient but I feel like I’m not doing this right. It’s really complicated for short girls to lose weight. Any tips?

This has not always been the case and I'm hoping there are things I can do to improve the issues and would like to find a doctor to help me with this but don't know where to look.

I don't think there is a ""physical"" cause of the deficit and assume the issues stem from childhood trauma and the resulting high levels of stress/anxiety. I have a cPTSD diagnosis and was diagnosed by a neurologist with FND during COVID after an MRI and other tests to rule out other causes of neurological symptoms I was experiencing at the time (intense numbness, paresthesia, and temperature regulation issues all over my body). I underwent intense trauma therapy and EMDR for about 2 years and have had minimal FND symptoms since. My memory problems pre-dated the neurological symptoms and unfortunately still remain.

I would love to find a doctor/specialist who can first run a large number of tests to really help me figure out where the issues are coming from. Is it encoding? Storage? Is it mostly my episodic memory? Long term? Middle term? Questions like this to really figure out where things are going wrong. And then depending on the results help me figure out the most evidence based way to improve things. Maybe there are supplements that could help, or specific memory exercises I could be doing every day, tricks i can use in certain situations, or lifestyle changes that might help, etc.

Maybe these are two separate people? A neuropsychologist for the initial testing and then some other doctor for the guidance once I pinpoint where things are going off the rails?

I am in a financially privileged position and this is something that is incredibly important to my life so I am not worried about cost. At the same time, I'm not interested in going to a ""celebrity"" type doctor or clinic that focuses more on what sells and makes people feel catered too. I just want help finding an evidence based way to help.

After 23 years, I had a small bowel strangulation in July.  Went to the ER and had a CT scan and emergency surgery. My original RNY bypassed area had apparently fallen a bit causing a hernia thay my intestines lopped around and eventually got twisted on, cutting off blood flow. It was the absolute most painful thing I have ever experienced. All went okay after surgery. I did not lose any bowel. It all ""pinked up"" after being untwisted. I did have a 6"" midline open incision. Spent a week in the hospital after but recovery went very well.  I thought I had survived a ""once in a lifetime "" event. 

Apparently not. In early November, just 4 months later, it happened again. Though this time instead of my intestines wrapping around a hernia from the RNY structure, it got caught on the scar tissue that formed after the surgery from July and developed a kink in the intestines that cut off blood flow again. This was less painful. For the first few hours, it felt like a regular old RNY ""dumping"" syndrome after eating something fatty like pizza. I had gone though that many times over the years - pain, pouring sweat, shaking. It was usually 4 hours on my hands and knees on the bathroom floor and some vomiting while waiting for it to pass. But this time it didn't pass. It got worse. After 5 hours, I figured it was something else and went to the ER. It was another strangulation.  Another CT scan and another surgery. This time, I lost a little over a foot of small intestines and came close to sepsis. I was given the strongest antibiotics they have via IV for days. I spent another week in the hospital.  This time, recovery is much slower and more painful. They went through the same 6"" midline incision. I have had  symptoms of bowel inflammation for a month now and can eat very little. I have lost 25 lbs - all muscle. I have weird little pains throughout my abdomen and mild nausea, but am able to eat a little and drink water and I do have bowel movements now, so things are moving along. But I don't get much sleep and trying to recover is still dominating my life.

The thing is, I feel like a ticking time bomb now. The surgeon said this was functionally different than the first strangulation. This one, while rare, can still happen to anyone who has had any  abdominal surgery and has internal scar tissue. But yes,  it can happen again. The only way to monitor it or tell if something is going wrong is another CT scan. You can only have so many of those in a year because of the amount of radiation. Basically, there is nothing I can do to prevent it from happening again at any time. I went from feeling so relieved and grateful at have survived the first one to now feeling like someone in a Final Destination movie, afraid that someday I won't make it to surgery in time. 

When a strangulation happens like this, the only treatment is emergency surgery to manually remove the blockage/twist. Since blood flow is cut off, the intestines can start dying within hours. If not treated fast enough, the intestines will die (as part of mine did this time) and eventually rupture, causing sepsis and death. I am afraid to travel or take a cruise or go anywhere more than an hour from a large hospital.

Whenever my **body heats up even slightly**, I get intense **itching, prickling, and burning sensations** all over, especially on my **back**. It happens instantly when:

* I walk into a warm room
* Sunlight hits my skin
* I get stressed, startled, or anxious
* I wear warm clothes
* I take a warm/hot shower
* I heat up from light activity or movement

I **don’t get hives** — just severe itching and burning.

The strange part is:  
**It disappears completely when I’m cold**, and I’m totally normal in summer.  
This only gets bad in winter.

I’ve been taking:

* **Allegra (morning)**
* **Locist Plus (cetirizine + montelukast) at night**

I have a palpable lump in my right breast and was referred for bilateral ultrasound and mammogram several weeks ago. I have known for years I have high breast density and have what one doctor called ""naturally lumpy breasts"" and no family history of breast cancer til late 80s so I was not exceedingly concerned.

My radiologist summarized that I have several cystic structures, along with microcalcifications, in my breasts. The largest of these is roughly 4 x 2 x 5 cm, and this, along with the others, were ""favored to represent complicated cysts, benign, BI-RADS 2."" Due to this low likelihood of malignancy, the imaging center recommended I come back for a followup mammogram in 6 months and didn't recommend I take any other action.   
  
However, when they sent the results to the nurse practitioner who had initially examined me for my referral, she called me in to explain my results and recommended I contact a ""breast surgeon"" to consult whether I need a biopsy or surgery. This really freaked me out as I thought I'd already received the all-clear from the radiologist. However, the NP was insistent, saying I need someone to look at these images who ""specializes in surgery for breasts and is used to interpreting these things."" I was confused and asked, ""Don't radiologists at breast imaging centers have experience interpreting these images?"" She said yes but they're not surgeons. I don't really know what she's getting at.

Her reasoning seemed to be that the 4 x 5 cyst is quite large and it needs to be ""dealt with"" regardless. I don't understand the rationale. If it's just that the cyst is large, I knew that without imaging--it's clearly palpable. If it's likely benign I don't want to cut into it for no reason. I also tried to look into finding a ""breast surgeon"" and I'm very confused how to find one without being referred by the imaging center, which seems to be the regular route. But since the imaging center doesn't think it's necessary I'm not sure how I'll get an appointment with a breast surgeon anyway. Should I take the NP seriously or is it safe to ignore her advice? She has no specialization in this area as far as I know.",,,,2025-12-02 09:00:35.154218+00,11,0,null,en,7,2025-12-02 06:49:49,21092,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1764658189,,,

For context, I have been checked out by a doctor and I am medically sound. No other long-lasting problems after I fainted, and only had a minor head injury, not even a concussion. It is suspected I fainted because I was stressed, tired and hadn't eaten that day, which makes sense and I dont see any other reasons that are applicable to me. 

Well, I fainted a few weeks ago, but since then I have been sleeping PERFECTLY. This is not normal for me whatsoever as I have dealt with insomnia for almost all of my life. I used to naturally fall asleep around 5-6am, and wake up at 2-4pm on average unless something kept me up. But now? I can easily conk out at 8pm, and have been waking up consistantly at 6am regardless of if I stay up a bit later than that. The reason behind this is genuinely beyond me, but this all happened pretty much overnight after I fainted, so unless this is some mad coincidence it points to that being the cause.

While this has been a genuine life saver for me, and I'm doing a lot more during the day, does anyone know why this is?? Should I be concerned about any medical issues or just take the blessing and not think about it too much?

It all started when I went to a physician for lower left abdominal pain and fever (the bp was 130/90) worried it was an infected appendix the doc advised a few tests

blood test: [https://ibb.co/LD6KVx3M](https://ibb.co/LD6KVx3M)

abdominal ultrasound: [https://ibb.co/6R0RNB1T](https://ibb.co/6R0RNB1T)

and diagnosed the pain is due to an urinary tract infection and gave a prescription for nitrofurantoin and citralka (disodium hydrogen citrate syrup) which I think I overdosed on because after 2 days of following the prescription there was a painful left side chest and arm pain which started on day 2 evening and continued till the next day evening when I couldn't stand it anymore and went to the hospital again this time the following tests were done

ekg: [https://ibb.co/nMy8NWf9](https://ibb.co/nMy8NWf9)

serum creatinine: [https://ibb.co/fG1rgqT0](https://ibb.co/fG1rgqT0)

and the blood pressure was 180/110 that day they discharged me back home and advised to take metprolol 25 mg daily. After 5 days of staying at home the pain did reduce but it was still there and I went to a interventional cardiologist to check again the initial tests were these: [https://ibb.co/FbZNzQhH](https://ibb.co/FbZNzQhH)

and after all these reports were normal it was advised that my bp was to be monitored for a week and it was around 125/75 at mornings 150/90 at midday after lunch and 130/85 at night after a week I went back and the doc advised to stop using metoprolol and suggested lifestyle changes instead such as brisk walking daily and diagnosed it as anxiety and yes it might have been that as at that time I got my entrance exam results and so was very tensed for a month or so.The lifestyle changes also worked and I lost a few kgs of weight and came down to 110 kgs.

For about four months now, I have been suffering from persistent voice and throat problems that started after a viral infection. Since then, my voice has never fully returned to normal. My main symptoms are ongoing hoarseness, a muffled and weak voice, and a constant “lump in the throat” sensation (globus feeling). I also feel tightness in my throat and neck, as if my muscles are permanently tense.

In the beginning, I had a burning sensation deep in the throat, which has mostly disappeared by now. However, what remains is a chronically irritated feeling, a dull voice quality, and the sense that my vocal cords are not working properly anymore. Sometimes it feels as though my voice gets “stuck” or does not come out freely, especially after speaking for some time.

About two months into this, I experienced a short period of around two weeks where I felt almost normal again. My voice was clearer, the lump sensation was nearly gone, and I thought I was finally recovering. Unfortunately, after this phase, everything worsened again without an obvious trigger.

I have a diagnosis of asthma bronchiale and had been using an inhaled corticosteroid (Revinty) for a long time. A specialist later told me that the steroid inhaler may have contributed to chronic irritation and inflammation of my vocal cords. On examination, only mild inflammatory and tissue changes were there and no severe structural damage was found. My vocal cords do not close completely during phonation, but no nodules, tumors, or paralysis were identified.

Reflux was suspected, although I do not have classic heartburn symptoms. I was put on pantoprazole as treatment for possible silent reflux. I have also been trying lifestyle changes such as stopping food several hours before sleep, sleeping on my side with my upper body elevated, and avoiding acidic or spicy foods. Despite these efforts, improvement has been minimal.

I was also diagnosed with tonsillitis more recently and paid antibiotics, which temporarily improved my symptoms. However, after finishing the antibiotics, the problems returned. I now mainly suffer from voice exhaustion, throat pressure, and the feeling that my voice is blocked or strained.

I have tried multiple ENT specialists, but none of them performed advanced diagnostic tests like stroboscopy or detailed voice analysis. Each examination shows only mild irritation, yet my symptoms are severely limiting my daily life. I am currently unable to secure an appointment for voice therapy, as waiting lists in my area are long, and I am stuck without professional treatment.

I follow all recommended measures: I drink plenty of fluids, reduce dust in my home, avoid evening meals, rest my voice as much as possible, and use lozenges for dry throat. I even tried inhalations, but they sometimes make the dryness and discomfort worse instead of helping.

At this point, I feel physically and mentally exhausted. I am frustrated because I am doing everything I am told, yet my voice does not recover. I am scared that this might become permanent, and I am honestly running out of hope. I just want my normal voice back and to live without constant discomfort.

My partner (37, male) has been showing severe mood-episode symptoms for several months. I submitted a collateral letter early October documenting the last couple of years of symptoms. Collateral documented several risk factors- he has children, had been using cocaine and alcohol, he forced me out of the home and threatened violence. He was assessed briefly by rangers at the start of this incident who had noted that he seemed manic. He had a nearly identical episode of this last year at the same time of year. He is not diagnosed with anything. He recently had a psychiatric appointment at a Federally Qualified Health Center. At that visit, I assume (not certain I only know that he told me got sober) he was asked to get sober to help rule out a substance-induced mood disorder. He has now been sober for about 4 weeks.

I submitted additional collateral two weeks ago (screenshots of text messages that documented symptoms -depression, paranoia, rage etc. during periods of sobriety and how it escalated during times of alcohol and drug use). They confirmed they received the collateral and cannot confirm anything else which I understand per HIPPA.
I submitted the collateral though it was unsolicited because he is high functioning and can seem very normal during these times-if I was meeting him I would not guess that he was having an episode. But he is currently manic and having persecutory thinking towards me, and has no insight. 
We are located in California if that makes any difference.

My question:
At an FQHC or community health center, how is urgent collateral normally handled?

Specifically

	1.	When collateral is read and received by the privacy officer, is it usually forwarded directly to the psychiatric provider? 

Note, I made it clear in the collateral that I did not expect information or updates about his care- I labeled the collateral for review only, I also cited several laws about why I believed collateral to be appropriate and important in this case.

	2.	Do FQHCs have a standard workflow for urgent collateral indicating possible mania/psychosis?

	3.	Would a provider typically review such collateral before or at the next appointment, even if the patient hasn’t volunteered the information? And how soon would they be looking to follow up with him?

	4.	If the patient is in an episode and not reporting symptoms clearly, does collateral play a role in accelerating diagnosis or medication decisions?

Best 5k was 21:58 (just for fitness context). 

First virus was 10 weeks ago (fever, nose, throat and chest, lots of yellow phlegm). I was nearly recovered, then caught a second virus (fever, phlegm and bad brain fog – likely COVID) I’ve been clear 6 weeks now. For a couple weeks after that I had of heaps of clear/white phlegm that jut caused a throat tickle and light cough, not deep or chesty, which is why I feel the current small amount is still from the chest and doing the same. Now I only occasionally get a throat tickle, small amounts of clear/white (sometimes slightly yellow) mucus, occasional dry cough, but some symptom-free days. Chest X-ray clear (done after one blood streak phlegm during first virus, looking back could have been from sinus’ just panicked at the time) No breathlessness. I can still run but fitness feels slightly reduced and my walking HR is higher than before the illness.

Does this sound like a normal long recovery after a couple big hits and lots of airway irritation, or something like COPD?

Got started almost 2 months ago after taking a break for a while to train for my first marathon. 99.9kg October 12th - a scary prospect, given that when I lost weight a couple of years ago I promised myself I'd never go above 100kg again. 

I lost 2kg in 2 weeks to start, down to 97.9kg. Sure some of it was water weight, but I believe if you lose the water weight you're on the right track.

2 weeks later, back up to 98.7kg. I went on holiday and enjoyed a couple of less healthy meals, but I consider that to be fine, I have no deadline.

It's now been another 4 weeks, and each time I've weighed myself I've been between 98.5kg and 98.9kg. Some thoughts I've had:

- If I keep doing what I did when I lost 2kg in 2 weeks, surely it should be coming down a little
- I've had two very stressful weeks during these last four weeks, last week I was on call at work, and another where I was working until 9-10pm each night so really struggled with sleep. There were definitely some signs of stress in those times, and I've read that cortisol can increase water retention
- So, maybe I should just keep going as I am until Christmas, see if it eventually falls off, if not make some changes.

But, I'm hungry a lot, I can't imagine reducing calories even further. I eat 2000kcal a day as a nearly 100kg man, I lift 3x per week, and I've kept up the running and go around 20-25km per week over 2 sessions. Plus I walk the dog almost every day for 45 mins. 

Maybe I'm miscounting calories, but then why did it work so well for the first two weeks? I'm confident I've changed nothing.

But recently I realized that maybe I've gained too much weight..  my clothes weren't fitting and I dont like myself when I look at the mirror. I dont weight myself because I've had trouble with ED in the past.
But well, I decided to go see a specialist and the doctor weighted me. Turns out ive gained a lot of weight in the last two years.
The nutritionist said she is specially concerned about my legs, as I tend to gain weight on my legs first.
Now I am afraid I am never going to be able to go back the way I was. That I won't be healthy again (she said the fat on my legs can be bad for blood circulation and I'm scared).

I was at 175 back in July. I now fluctuate between 152-154 usually with my lowest being 150.3. I am trying to get down to 145ish. I know the progress is there, I've lost weight in my face and basically everywhere else except where I want it(I hate you genetics).

I hit the gym 5 times a week. I do PPL. I also do about 2.5-3mile walks Mon-Friday. So with that in mind, you would think it would shed off quickly with my diet:

I tend to have a protein shake in the morning for 150cals(just powder and water) and 30grams of protein. It is whey protein.

My lunch is usually 4oz -6oz chicken with one serving if white rice. And my dinner is roughly the same with me changing the meat to either turkey, chicken, or fish and my side being again rice. I also get about 7-8 hours of sleep. I drink nothing but water.

I honestly think my main culprits are: I either eat way too late for dinner(9PM because I am so busy) or I am not eating enough.

Again you would think how active I am, I'd would of gotten where I need to be. And I haven't. I usually have one cheat day a week but it is never a REALLY big cheat day. Its moreover, just some fast food on Sundays, that's it.

I am just frustrated that for one, I feel like I am not losing weight(probably because of muscle growth. I notice more muscle growth then the actual loss of BF) but my BF% isnt really going down.

The last time I posted here was about two years ago. Back then I was around 152 lbs and wasn’t paying much attention to what I ate or how active I was. I’m 5’6.5”, and now I’m at 129 lbs. I’m happy with the progress, but I’m still working toward my goal range of 118 to 120 lbs.

For most of this time, dancing was the only consistent exercise I had. I go about two to three times a week, sometimes more if my schedule works out. It’s the one workout I never dread because it makes me feel strong, coordinated, and actually connected to my body in a way the gym never did. But even with dancing, I realized it wasn’t enough for me to reach the next stage. I wasn’t paying attention to how much I was eating, and I leaned a lot on quick snacks like cookies, pastries, or whatever was easy.

So now I’ve started calorie counting. Nothing intense, just honest tracking so I actually understand what I’m taking in. It’s already been really eye opening. Instead of grabbing cookies when I’m hungry, I’ve been adding more vegetables to my meals, things that fill me up without blowing through my calories for the day. I’m noticing I feel more satisfied, less bloated, and more in control.

This time around, I’m trying to stay consistent, stay patient, and keep things simple. Dancing keeps me moving, calorie counting keeps me structured, and vegetables help with volume.

They aren’t really stretch marked so it isn’t to do with skin, and I know overweight people tend to have thicker calf muscles generally, but there is also a lot of dangling fat when I lift my legs up and it just seems so stubborn to shift.

I know that no exercise can target a specific body part, but has anyone else who has lost a lot of weight noticed a part of their body doesn’t lose that much or anything at all, until you get to a certain point? I’m trying to be hopeful, I still have a little way to go (in comparison to how far I’ve come) and would ideally like to lose another 20kg and see how I feel/look then, it also gives me some more time to keep saving for surgery to get my loose skin dealt with too.

Mandolin was clean (first time using it 🤦🏻‍♀️)  and on the second setting which was a little bigger than 1/16"". Took part of my nail with it and since it was a clean cut, couldn't stitch anything back together.

Nov 10th I started getting a sore throat and cough, which progressively got worse. Negative for Covid and strep (checked by my PCP, fast strep and culture both negative). Mucinex and Sudafed given at first, then prescribed Tessalon when it got really bad. Tessalon, mucinex/dayquil, cough drops and ginger tea helped manage my symptoms but the cough was very bad. I was told it was viral since I had no fever or any other symptoms. 

A week ago I felt I had strained my left pec and an abdominal muscle on the bottom left of my abdomen, near my sigmoid colon. I think this was just from the intense coughing. Got better but then a sharp chest pain began in the center, mostly localized to my sternum. This started last week. Cough is much better but still there, dry now mostly. The main issue I now have is this chest pain, for which I went to urgent care yesterday. 

At rest the pain is about a 2/3, worse when supine, better sitting up and leaning forward slightly. Pain increases on inspiration, especially deep inspiration and MUCH worse when I cough, which is still frequent. Pain shoots up to a 9 when I cough. Movement like driving, lifting up my cats, walking in the cold, or sitting up from a lying position are causing me pain. I have a relatively high pain threshold so this is significant for me. 

EKG, CXR, CBC all normal. My cholesterol is 223 (LDL: 113, down from 126 last year), I’ve had a VSG and appendectomy, and my mom has a stent in her LAD, hyperthyroidism, and DM2. I had mild to moderate chest pain at rest a few months ago, after which I had a full work up done, which was normal. I already have an echo scheduled in two weeks, but I’m trying to get it moved up. 

Two doctors I spoke to are suspecting pericarditis. Is that possible after an upper respiratory infection and what does this mean for my recovery? I have a physically demanding job and I had to take medical leave this week. I was prescribed cyclobenzaprine to help with the pain. I was under the assumption that this was a severe muscle sprain from the coughing, but when I described the pain as “like I cracked a rib” and explained my symptoms, they urged me to get an echo. 

I just want to get better so I can get back to work. Any insight is much appreciated, thank you in advance.

This year has been especially bad; I’ve cumulatively been sick for 3-4 months since January. I cannot figure out why I get hit so hard for colds that last for so long.

What should I do to prevent or protect myself against colds like this? Should I go see a doctor or something? I don’t even know what kind of doctor I would talk to?

Even if I don’t have a cold, I almost always have what feels like post nasal drip, and need to clear my throat constantly. I heard it might be reflux, but I tried taking something for that for over a month and saw no improvement.

We’re concerned due to his advanced age his problem is not a great concern to NHS doctors, so we went private. Still no answers. Really hoping some of the good people here can give us any helpful info or advice.

The Issue:

Dad is overheating. 

He describes it as an intense surface skin burning to the point he feels his skin could blister. His skin is hot to the touch at these points but no fever. However he only sweats in the normal places, under arms etc and not when he’s having a ‘heat attack.’ These symptoms are incredibly uncomfortable for him.

It started on his back and has spread down his limbs. It comes and goes despite the weather or room temperature. He strips off to his vest and then in due course will feel cold so puts a jumper on. It interrupts his rest as his skin gets so hot he can’t sleep.

It’s so uncomfortable he’s asked me not to let them lay him on his back if he’s ever hospitalised and cannot turn himself. 

About Dad

At 84, my dad is very active and in generally good health. He still drives, goes on holidays, and fixes things in his house and garden, and his daughters houses too. He was an electrician. He doesn’t drink or smoke. 

Height: 
170cm 

Weight: 
70kg

Conditions: 

High Blood Pressue
High Cholesterol 
Ischaemic Heart Diseae - mild CAD in single vessel
Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia 
Small polyps on the Pancreas (non cancerous)

Tests:

All the below tests have been taken and returned as normal.

serum testerone 
thyroid function test 
full blood voubt
HbA1c level 
serum lipids 
renal profile
bone profile 

Any insight or advice on what’s going on and how we might address it medically would be much appreaicted by us both.

Could his condition be related to Androhidrosis?
How would we go about testing for this?

He does sweat normally as I mentioned, however no ‘extra’ sweat when he’s having a ‘heat attack’ and doesn’t have a fever. 

I really want the old boy to have the best retirement he can. he deserves it on so many levels. The lack of answers is driving him mad, as well as all the discomfort.

And tried the Mirena IUD at one point as well.

I am on oral medications and Ozempic for diabetes.  I do not smoke or use recreational drugs, and drink very rarely (&lt;1 drink per week).

For background, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when I was about 30, and did not really take it seriously at first.  I first started treating it seriously in my mid-30s, but still struggled with my A1C for years.  Fast forward to summer of 2024.  I got blisters on the bottoms of both my feet that developed into diabetic ulcers. They both got infected (staph), and one of the infections got into the bones of the second toe on my left foot.  We caught that infection when it went septic.  I was hospitalized for a week, they amputated the toe, and I was off my feet and out of work for nearly three months.  I was receiving IV antibiotics for a month of that time through a PICC-line.  Since that time, I have been hospitalized twice for infections that went septic, but were fortunate to catch them before they spread to the bone.

To add to this, I have a deformation on the 5th toe of my right foot that forces the toe to ride up on top of the 4th toe, and forces the metatarsal down, and for years I have had problems with calluses and blisters on the bottom of my foot in that location.  That has been the source of at least three staph infections.  The most recent one created a deep ulcer that was hidden under a callus, and was only revealed when it got infected and the callus came off.  The podiatrist gave me three options: 1. Treat the infection and hope I catch the next one early (he says that there will definitely be a ""next time""). 2. Surgically reconstruct the toe (probably multiple surgeries) with no guarantee that it will fix the problem. 3. Amputate the toe, contour the metatarsal, and that should fix at least THAT part of the problem.  He says that this option, while seeming the most extreme, has the most PREDICTABLE outcome.

I do take much better care of myself and my A1C now, but that doesn't make up for the 25 years of abuse I put my body through.  I have excellent hygiene, and we keep the shower IMMACULATE, but I still get these infections. Given my history and my seeming susceptibility to staph infections and sepsis, does it make sense to amputate my little toe even though the bone shows no signs of infection?

(29M)","This post isn’t about me but about my boyfriend (29M). He has been struggling with sudden “anxiety-like” episodes for about 2 years, including sudden warmth, sweaty hands, nausea, dizziness, and headaches. These episodes happen off and on, sometimes daily for months. He has had multiple tests including bloodwork, a CT scan, and several exams, all normal. The only finding was likely chronic gastritis, so he was prescribed stomach-coating medication.

Recently, right before a planned trip, he started having full panic-attack-like episodes. Since all prior tests were normal, I suggested this might be severe anxiety, so he saw a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist prescribed Mexazolam to be used as needed for SOS, Lorsedal (lorazepam) at night to help him sleep, and Cipralex (escitalopram) daily. He improved for a few days, but now he has developed new chest pressure and pain on the left side, described as “something extra is there.” We are unsure if this is a medication side effect, anxiety, low blood pressure, or something more serious.

His blood pressure has also been low recently, making him feel weak. The psychiatrist mentioned that his symptoms could be thyroid-related, but he can only get thyroid blood tests in two months. We’re unsure if this new chest pressure could be caused by the medications, low blood pressure, anxiety, or something urgent.

Few months later, i started lactating out of nowhere and went to my gynac. She asked me to speak with my psychiatrist and also get mri done. Psychiatrist changed medication which generally did increase prolactin levels and mri was 100% normal. Eventually prolactin lowered and i got my period too. Now 6 months later my prolactin is again high and ive developed thyroid (reversible stage) too. Gynac again asked me to speak to psychiatrist and he said yes maybe due to medication again and he changed the medication today.

I am 33 male. No prescribed medication.

I am on holiday travelling through south east Asia and currently in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Before leaving to go on this holiday I attend a travel clinic for the recommended vaccinations. I opted out of receiving the rabies vaccine as receiving five vaccinations in one go was enough to make me pass out in the waiting room of the doctors office and finally made me come to terms with my fear of needles.

While I was having dinner in the city a potentially stray (possible pregnant) small cat walked past and bit my hand. I’m not sure if it broke the skin but there are two small teeth marks where it bit me. I went to a pharmacy across the road to seek advice. When they suggested I go to the hospital for potential rabies shots I passed out in the pharmacy. They called an ambulance and I was taken to the nearby hospital. The doctor there asked me about the cat that bit me and if I was bleeding from the wound which I was not. While he didn’t not expressly mention the need for a vaccine, I believe he considered the risks and did not think it necessary. He took my vitals, told me to wait five minutes until my colour came back, then sent me on my way. 

Should I still seek a rabies vaccine?",,,,2025-12-01 18:00:27.633463+00,1,0,null,en,2,2025-12-01 16:26:46,21018,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1764606406,,,

I am currently recovering from an illness that caused an excruciating sore throat/fever, that came back positive for F. necrophorum. I am on day 3 of antibiotics and feeling pretty much back to normal after a miserable six days of symptoms. There is not a whole lot of info about this illness online, and my PCP is unable to see me for the next several weeks, so figured I'd ask some questions here:

1. Earlier this month (about 2.5 weeks before my first F-throat symptoms) I had a nasty cold that may or may not have been COVID, I didn't test. From my online research it seems that this was the likely cause of the infection. Is there any way to prevent this happening in the future when I get a respiratory virus? I don't want to have to worry about it every time I get a cold.

2. From my online research it seems like this infection is not contagious and I don't need to worry about passing it to my husband, is that correct? I read that it can pass through mucus membranes - is it ok to kiss or have sex? Should we wait until a certain number of days on antibiotics?

3. Anything I should keep in mind as I recover? For instance I know they say to replace your toothbrush after tonsillitis, should I do that/are there any other little things like that I should keep in mind?

I messaged my PCP and she said that it is probably not any cause for concern, unless I have other symptoms (vision changes, weakness, fatigue), in which case we could look into doing a neurological exam.

The impact point was anterior; however, the force of the trauma caused the rupture to extend posteriorly (likely a scleral burst). Local surgeons were unable to address the posterior damage, so the patient was transferred to Vienna.

**Surgical Management (Right Eye - Injured):**

1. **Primary Reconstruction:** The team in Vienna performed a comprehensive repair, suturing the globe both anteriorly and posteriorly. The surgeons reported that the intraocular pressure (IOP) stabilized quickly, and they estimated a &gt;50% chance of visual recovery.
2. **Retinal Surgery (Day 8):** Today, 8 days post-injury, he underwent a vitrectomy for retinal reattachment. A gas tamponade was used, and the patient has been instructed to maintain a face-down position for one week.
   * *Specific Question:* Is the use of gas tamponade in this context considered a positive prognostic indicator?

**Current Status (Injured Eye):** Post-operative recovery has been rapid. Four days after the primary reconstruction, the IOP was perfect. Following today's retinal surgery, the surgeons expressed satisfaction with the eye's regeneration and pressure levels. (Please see the attached photo taken after the primary reconstruction).

* Occasional ""flashes"" of clearer vision.
* The ability to read mobile phone text at a very close range (10-15 cm).

The hospital for my finger, straightened it and I have a splint. I’m seeing a surgeon this Wednesday 11/3/2025. 

I’m supposed to be flying back to work this week. Has anyone dealt with this or know the potential surgery (if needed) or recovery?

There was an immediate dull pain but nothing too noteworthy, I caught myself and finished urinating with no issues.

However, the next time I urinated, it was accompanied by a sharp pain and a few beads of blood coming from my penis after urinating. This persisted but slowly let up after the next few urinations before stopping entirely. However, ever since this event, any time my penis is angled downwards when I urinate (such as if I'm sitting down at the toilet and need to aim it downwards to pee in the bowl), it triggers this sharp pain again, often accompanied by the same bleeding until it heals again. It just happened again today. When I urinate with my penis in its natural position there are no issues (after the pain heals from the triggering event), but any time I attempt to urinate with any kind of tension on my penis I seem to injure myself. There aren't any additional physical symptoms beyond what I've mentioned, but I have noticed I'm more lethargic and depressed since this issue started.

Obviously, due to the nature of the issue, I'm reluctant to see a doctor but I understand that will probably be the advice, regardless. Searching online for this issue has me scared that it could be something serious like prostate or bladder cancer, since this issue has persisted longer than other common causes like UTIs, and I've never passed any kind of kidney stones or anything, but given how this all started, I wonder if it may be more likely to be some kind of physical injury in my urethra that's simply slow to heal and I keep re-opening the wound when urinating.

I take no medications currently, though I do habitually smoke marijuana.

Ultimately I will end up visiting the doctor when I get over my embarrassment but I wanted to see if anyone in this community could make some guesses as to what to expect in terms of severity because I'm very anxious about this.",,,,2025-12-01 18:00:27.633463+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-12-01 17:35:23,20998,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1764610523,,,

I’ve posted on Reddit about this before but am hoping to get some new opinions about my undiagnosed chronic condition/symptoms. No worries if you’re NAD, would still be curious to hear everyone’s thoughts and maybe find some new things to look into. 



Profile: I am a 24 year old woman, 5’2 and 105lbs. I don’t smoke but I drink socially. I work a 9-5 in NYC. 



Onset (2020): In January of 2020, I had a sinus infection over winter break from college and was prescribed a Z-Pac (Azithromycin) and 3 days of Prednisone for swelling. Took with no issue and infection went away. However, over the next couple of weeks I started to get very bad heartburn, which I had never really had before. Started taking Prilosec with no relief. Doc prescribed a PPI (can’t remember which one, ultimately ended up trying multiple to try and get some relief) but it didn’t help…it actually made my stomach start to hurt really badly. Soon, I was unable to drink alcohol (would throw up if I did), was on a diet of GF oatmeal, bananas and tofu, and was having constant stomach pain. I also started noticing bloating and diarrhea. 



My symptoms were becoming unmanageable. I was missing class and laying in bed all day in pain, or stuck in the bathroom. I left school for a week to get tests done in the city, meeting with a GI who did blood work, a stool test and colonoscopy/endoscopy with biopsies. After all of these tests were performed, it was concluded that I did NOT have celiac disease or H-pylori. The doctor said that he saw mild inflammation in the stomach (gastritis), mild acid reflux and mild inflammation at the end of the small intestine (ileitis). That said, he did not think it was IBD (Crohn’s, UC). He prescribed me Xifaxan for probable SIBO and sent me back to school.



The Xifaxan did nothing. Didn’t help, didn’t hurt. But what did hurt was my stomach…a lot. I was now getting severe, painful bloating and nausea as well. I was losing weight from my limited diet and becoming anxious and depressed. I left school in March for COVID lockdown with no answers still. Once back in the city, I met with a naturopathic MD who did a stool test and found that I had no beneficial gut bacteria growing (ex. Lactobacillus) and some pathogenic bacteria (two strains of citrobacter). Seeing this, the naturopath prescribed me some supplements and digestive enzymes plus Candibactin, which is an herbal antibiotic to kill citrobacter. Unfortunately, everything she gave me made me so sick! This is when the severe nausea began. Some days, I couldn’t even get out of bed. Important to note here that my nausea is non-productive — even when I really feel the need to throw up, I do not. I decided to stop the medications she gave me and see if I started to feel better.



Symptom Progression &amp; Treatments (2021-2025): For the last 5 years, I have been experimenting with lots of different treatments, doctors and diagnoses. In 2021, I had a small pill cam endoscopy to definitively rule out Crohn’s, Colitis and Celiac and this detailed study also showed that I no longer had inflammation in my ileum. I also started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and began taking SSRIs. But my symptoms persisted. Now, I was back at school for my sophomore year and mainly struggling with nausea, wildly fluctuating appetite and severe stomach pain. I started to receive accommodations so I could do schoolwork from my bed on especially bad days, and I became close with another girl in my dorm who was also suffering from a chronic condition. At this point, I was beginning to accept that this was my new reality, but I also wasn’t giving up. The summer before my junior year, I met with a Chinese herbalist who made me a custom tea blend with around 10 different roots, herbs and bark to heal my stomach. He believed that the PPIs I took in 2020 had caused everything and that my stomach needed to heal. I drank the tea for around 8 months, and it helped! I noticed less stomach pain and less nausea. However, my mental health was doing terrible, specifically my depression. We concluded that, unfortunately, one or more of the herbs was interacting with my SSRIs and making me miserable. I had to stop drinking the tea.



In late 2022, I did a semester back in the city and got norovirus. I had a fever and was wildly nauseous for a week but never once threw up. It was miserable. At this time I also noticed that I have (maybe always had) R-CPD — never formally diagnosed, but definitely can’t burp at all lol. I had started drinking alcohol again and was doing OK…still struggling with painful bloating and stomach aches but less nausea. By this time, I had also been completely gluten-free and animal-product free for around a solid year. Now, I eat eggs and fish but still avoid dairy and gluten. In spring of 2023, weeks before I was set to graduate college, I woke up in the morning with the most violent nausea I have ever experienced and severe flank pain. I ran to the toilet, convinced that this was the time I would actually be sick, but even now I could not throw up. But I knew something was very wrong. I called campus safety to take me to the ER, and there they diagnosed me with 3 kidney stones and said they would pass on their own. My mom came to pick me up and take me home to recover. Long story short, my stones did not pass on their own. Instead, one of them presumably got stuck and caused pyelonephritis, bad enough that the surgical team found septic fluid in my kidney when they went in to do the surgery after days of me insisting that something was terribly wrong. I was OK thankfully, but had to be on Flomax for a month afterwards and have another surgery to make sure the stones had passed (they had). It was a terrible time and I felt sick for months after. 



That said, I still graduated in May of 2023 and walked with my class. For the last year and a half, I have started working a corporate job, but my health has only gotten worse. Now, I have severe nausea almost every day and terrible stomach pain no matter what I eat or do — I always say, I could eat boiled rice all day and my stomach would still hurt. In August, I started seeing an acupuncturist and have found some relief from this. But I am still struggling with all of these symptoms every single day, with my average level of pain + nausea at around a 4. It stops me from doing daily tasks often, and I find myself in the work bathroom taking deep breaths multiple times a day to quell the queasy feeling that never seems to go away. Currently, I am still on SSRIs and am taking Klonopin as needed for anxiety. My acupuncturist started me on an anti-parasitic for suspected Giardia, though this has never been found on a medical test. In 2022, I was diagnosed with a Strongyloides parasite which I took a course of Ivermectin for with no change to my chronic symptoms.



I should also note that I have struggled with UTIs and kidney stones for the past 5 years as well. When I was younger I suffered from urinary reflux and had to have a corrective surgery at 3/4 years old to reroute my ureters. This has made me more prone in my adult life to UTIs and, as it seems, kidney stones. I have had one more recurrence of kidney stones since 2023, we think, although when the urologist went in to remove the stone they did not find it and instead saw some residual silicone in my ureter from an experimental procedure I had as a child. We have always wondered as a family if this experimental procedure (which involved injecting medical-grade silicone into my ureters, it has now been honed and is a common urologic procedure) could be the root of my problems somehow.



Thank you so much if you took the time to read all of this. I just want some relief from my pain and nausea so I can live as a normal, healthy 24 year old.",,,,2025-12-01 18:00:27.633463+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-12-01 17:41:19,20997,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1764610879,,,

Hi. Been having one sided throat pain for a week at least. Some days worse than others. Morning is definitely worst when I wake up. I always have tons of post nasal drip. Really hurts to swallow. Sometimes that ear hurts too. Am waiting for my serum to be made to do immunotherapy w/Allergist (allergies to cats, dogs, dust, grass, trees, weeds, molds) Thought this pain was to do with my allergies but Allergist looked at my throat and says no, it's from my GERD. I thought my GERD was relatively under control w/my protonix. I don't have burning or anything. 

How can you tell by looking at a throat if its caused by reflux or allergies? Also-- if that is the case what medicine can i take or what can i do to help it? My gi treats the gerd, should I see her for the sore throat? Thanks.

I take a multivitamin every day plus iron, no other medications. I have had IBS-C for most of my life. During the summer, I was diagnosed with gastritis.

For about two weeks, I have had this sensation in my right kidney area. The back of my flank, beneath my bottom rib, is sore when I press on it. The ribs are also sore in the front on my right side. If I were to grab my flank, like wrap my hand around my side and squeeze, it is sore, too. So basically my whole right side is sore when I palpate it. I also seem to have this gurgling that seems like it’s from my stomach, but only happens on my right side. In general, that area of my flank also feels itchy on my skin, which is weird. No rashes at all.

I also noticed I have general malaise, like slight nausea and even internal tremors. I have not vomited nor had a fever.

About two months ago I was told I had a small kidney stone, 3mm hanging out in the lower pole which I was told wouldn’t cause any issues. This was diagnosed via ultrasound. Could this be related? Or IBS related? If I were to rank the most annoying symptoms to least, it would be: 1. Itchiness 2. Soreness/pain 3. Nausea.

Sometimes she eats a bit too much, but she avoids sweets, etc. She’s very different from before. Even if she eats a little more sometimes, they still only eat 2 meals a day, and their food matches the calories they need per day. They’ve been going to the gym for 3 months now.

Her husband wants her to be extremely strict with food, eat less, and push harder at the gym—like he’s rushing her progress. She said she’s no longer enjoying her weight loss journey. And when she cheats once a week (like eating a small sweet bread), they immediately fight. She feels suffocated.

Great family, but terrible eating habits. His brother is 400+ lbs (maybe 450+). They’re southern, so the food is especially heavy / calorie dense - also not really my favorite. Last year I ate too much and felt gross. This year I took very small portions (like 1 bite of each dish), knowing I could go back for more - I never did. 

I tracked calories as best I could and got a walk in each day, but also didn’t stress about it and ate sweets / alcohol in moderation. I estimated I was in deficit each day. We got back and I weighed in the next morning…

175

My lowest weight probably since age 25 (now 45). This also puts my BMI below 30…. Meaning I’ve moved from obese to overweight for the first time. 

For a holiday all about eating as much as you can (why America, why?!), this feels like a miracle. But the real victories were NSV: I put less food on my plate. I didn’t feel obligated to eat just because other people were. I listened to my body.

It is that when you buy food, be it at a restaurant or grocery store, you are buying yourself the option of eating it and not the obligation. Especially with the holiday season and food gifts, there is a feeling that can be hard to shake that if you don't eat every single one of those limited edition chocolates that you impulse bought that they were a waste. I found myself eating them faster just to get it over with. At restaurants, not eating everything they give you can feel like a waste of money. But thinking of it as buying the option of eating as much as you feel like (rather than the amount they give you) makes it a lot easier to leave the fries/chips/toast/whatever filler sides they throw on there.

My cousin grew up with a really big body. They don’t have kids yet and she doesn’t have PCOS. She and her husband have been married for 5 years. They go to the gym—sometimes 2x a week when busy, usually 3x a week. They do weight training. My cousin is getting smaller; her weight hasn’t changed a lot but she already lost around 3–5 inches from her body.

Yesterday, I talked to her and she said she’s struggling because her husband is very strict about calorie deficit. Sometimes she eats a bit too much, but she avoids sweets, etc. She’s very different from before. Even if she eats a little more sometimes, they still only eat 2 meals a day, and their food matches the calories they need per day. They’ve been going to the gym for 3 months now.

Her husband wants her to be extremely strict with food, eat less, and push harder at the gym—like he’s rushing her progress. She said she’s no longer enjoying her weight loss journey. And when she cheats once a week (like eating a small sweet bread), they immediately fight. She feels suffocated.

My husband , 32 male USA FL resident  5 FT 10 about 210lbs. Non smoker or drinker , only medication he takes is for migraines. had a log basically dropped on his hand at work. His hand blew up like a balloon and we honestly thought it was broken. He had an x ray done and the urgent care (urgent care provided by his job as we currently don't have insurance and they filed a workers comp claim ) said it was a bone contusion and to come back in a few days for another x ray. The second x ray he agreed still no breaks just a bone contusion but my husband s still in a significant amount of pain. The doctor didn't wrap it or do anything honestly. 
We are worried a break is being missed or can they really be this painful ? The doctor was pretty nonchalant and said he can go back to work and do all the normal heavy lifting but my husband can barely close his hand. I'm not sure if the doctor is sort of half assing us bc he is part of the workers comp team or what. 
Could a bone contusion really cause this much pain ? We are worried if it broke and he goes back to his heavy lifting job he's just going to make it worse for a potential break.

I’m currently an inpatient in hospital. I originally went to hospital for abdominal pain, low right quadrant that spread to the right side of body and low right back.

But they’ve also been doing blood film checking, which the results seems concerning to me. My doctor said she isn’t concerned considering the FBC looks fine. I’m just seeking another opinion if my concern is warranted or not. 

I can’t attach pictures but is there anytime blood film even matters if full blood count looks ok?

I have a bit of an… embarrassing… issue but I figure you guys are used to helping people with their embarrassing issues. I’m a nurse myself, so I’m used to talking about personal things with my patients, so I’ll swallow my pride and get a little personal about myself. I am 31F. I consider myself to be fairly healthy.

I walk a ton and try to get at least some fiber (though I probably could get more 😞) . I am very regular. I have a large formed BM right after drinking coffee every single morning like clockwork. However, sometimes it is a little tougher than others. I wouldn’t really consider myself chronically constipated, but you know, some days are tougher than others. I have a chronic fissure. It was flared up for a handful of days a couple weeks ago. Then I had a good week or so. But this morning, I had to push a little bit and I felt it was big and hard and immediately felt sharp pain. I’m not ever straining, but you know, there are some days when you need to put in a little work to make stuff happen. Having a fissure on a somewhat-regular basis is painful and uncomfortable. I gently cleaned up and used some A&amp;D ointment afterwards to soothe the area, which did help. But I’m getting nervous ability going tomorrow morning. I really don’t wan to go #2 when my body is like this because I know it will hurt. But at the same time, I know that I need to go when I feel like I need to, otherwise I really am going to be in a world of hurt and misery! Is there anything I can do that might help my back end?

For the past two weeks I’ve started feeling confused when this happens. It’s like my brain suddenly gets really fuzzy and hot and I just want to lie down and close my eyes.

 I really appreciate the time anyone gives here to answer my questions. I want to get into a relationship with a woman who has genital HSV1, and she actually told me beforehand and had the concern I would not be comfortable due to it.  
   
I respect that a lot, and I do know she is a very good person, as I have had interactions with her over the last 2+ years, so I don’t want to reject her simply based on that, since I know alot of it is stigma, but also I am very health conscious and do not wish to get it myself.

  
Background: I am a 29 year old male, healthy, no known serious health issues, semi active. She is female 27, she has had genital HSV1 for about 10 years, she maybe has an outbreak once every 2-3 years, she does not have oral HSV1, and she is very health conscious about it.  
   
I would really appreciate the answer to the following either by those who have scientific knowledge (references are very much appreciated!), or real life experiences, depending on the question:

1. What are the chances I get it, since she does not have an outbreak but once every 2-3 years, and she has had it for 10 years?
2. What is the asymptomatic shedding rate?
3. If she takes and antiviral, how much does it reduce the chances of me getting it?
4. What are the safest practices I should observe when having sex?
5. Since she only has GENITAL HSV1 is it possible to her ORAL HSV1 from kissing, saliva, sharing utensils, cups, baths etc.?
6. Can it be transmitted to me in any way other than sex?
7. If she does not have an active outbreak, and is not shedding asymptomatically , can I still get it? Or is it only contagious in either of those scenarios?
8. I know this might be for another subreddit, but has anyone here been in a long term relationship and not gotten it?

Thank you all in advance!

Concern #2: I have these weird, red spots on my body that won’t go away. I first started noticing them a few years ago. The spots start out small but eventually “spread” out, making the redness appear even more. The skin over the spots is glossy and you can feel a slight bump. They’re not cherry angiomas, but they do seem to be little “pockets” where blood pools. I’ve pricked these spots in the past to “drain” them, and they will bleed for a while but eventually stop. Some have disappeared but others keep growing and some haven even come back. They don’t cause pain unless I prick them; it feels like I’m poking a nerve or something lol, very sensitive and make the area around it hurt a lot like when you touch a bruise.

I'm 99% sure I have a hernia, about a week ago I was pushing way too hard while constipated and heard a pop of air pushed out of my anus and then I was super bloated when I woke up the next day, with a lump above my rib on the left side and some small like spotting, almost like bruising but just little dots. I've been bloated since and never feel like I can empty my bowel so I have a doctors appointment on tuesday, but just tonight I was sitting at my desk and suddenly felt the need to go poop really badly, so I got up and went to the bathroom. I lifted up my shirt and saw the area just to the right of the lump above my ribs has a bruise forming, the little dots had become a streak about 5 inches long going up from next to the lump towards my nipple. This bruise forming is bruise colored like purple red. I also couldn't poop despite having to rush to the bathroom, I farted and a little liquid came out but no log or anything which was odd because I was just able to poop around 4 hours ago.

31933,reddit.com,t3_1pb764q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pb764q/is_it_normal_to_have_constant_double_vision_even/,Is it normal to have constant double vision even with one eye closed (while still maintaining perfect vision?),"So, I'm going to start out by saying it has been this way my whole life. I'm almost 40 (male) with no known medical issues. I do not believe this is related to any kind of emergency condition as I've noticed it since at least kindergarten. 

To be clear on what I'm describing. Overall my vision has always been rated as exceptional. I can almost always read the bottom lines on all the eye exams and can see fine details with ease. At 6 feet tall I can spot a 4 leaf clover in the grass while walking without specifically looking for them. I can see the individual leaves on trees from quite a distance. I don't have or need any corrective lenses. 

That being said, everything I'm not focused on is doubled. Example, laying on my bed typing this up I see 1 phone and 2 hands typing but I have 4 feet propped up on the pillow with 2 tvs behind them and my dog laying on his back with 6 legs casually sticking up in the air. If I switch my vision to the TV I will suddenly have 2 phones with 4 hands. It doesn't really matter how far away the objects are, I still see double of whatever I'm not focusing on. Like if I'm looking at something 200 meters away, the things close are doubled but the things at distance are crisp, if I switch to focusing on any object in between, the objects in front of and behind it are doubled. 

As for the doubled images, they are typically transparent as long as not being overlapped with themselves or another object. Like if I hold my hand in front of the TV, I have 10 semi transparent fingers that partially overlap. If I hold up a single finger at arms length with the TV (or picture or whatever object I want to focus on) about 15 feet away, I get 2 transparent fingers that appear to be about 2 inches apart from each other, if I turn it sideways, I get a blurry but otherwise normal looking finger with an additional 2 ghost knuckles extending past the end. 

Usually the doubled images are perfectly parallel but if I'm relaxed enough and let my eyes unfocus entirely they can shift up and down or even drift diagonally away from each other. 

I dont lose fine details. I can still see every wrinkle and hair on both fingers while looking at the TV however if I try to focus on them they will merge back into a single finger while the TV starts to seperate. 

It doesn't effect my daily life. My eyes are very quick to adjust between objects and I can perform most tasks while they are still doubled. Even things like reading or typing up this post dont require me to focus on my phone, I just ignore the ghost phone and type with the solid parts of my fingers on the right set of letters. The only time I really need to focus it back into one image is when trying to relocate my cursor. 

I always assumed it was normal. I was probably in my 20s before it came up in a conversation. My sister described something similar but not nearly to the degree I have because it only happens with very close objects with her but she also wears glasses. My brothers, mom and all my friends I've talked to about it just look at me like I'm crazy or tell me to go get glasses, which I don't need.

From what I've gathered from talking with others, they get the same effect when holding a finger really close to their face but don't have it happen at any kind of a distance. It's like how everyone has a blurry nose in their vision that they've learned to ignore but for me it's literally everything all the time. 

One final note. It still happens when I close either eye. Not nearly as much though, I don't get a full doubling, more like a 10% overlap between the objects where as with both eyes open it is anywhere from a 50-100% shifting of the images. Like with the finger example it is hard to notice if I hold 1 finger upright, it will just have blurry edges but it if turn it sideways it will be about half a nails length longer than it should be. 

Now, if I place my hand between my eyes creating a divider and hold a finger in front of my right eye where my left eye cant see it. I'll have a transparent hand that doesn't seem to block my vision of the TV and a single but partially doubled finger. As I move it to my left it becomes transparent as it passes the barrier and after a certain point I'll see the ghost finger start to appear and eventually it goes back to one finger. 

Honestly, the only time it really bothers me is when looking at a computer screen for too long. I get tired of focusing after a while and my eyes let the screens seperate. While I can read books and my phone like this, its really hard on a work computer with terrible layouts that will have images and text parallel with each other making it extra hard to read doubled text. Otherwise when I get really tired it can be hard to focus my vision but I've grown so used to it that I barely notice.

He’s active at his job as a contractor but he smokes and drinks a LOT and takes some kind of NSAID almost daily. (He gets a lot of headaches). Does not wear sunscreen and works outside year round. I’m not sure if he’s ever had a vegetable, but he does do ok getting a decent amount of water. He is scared to go to the doctor, but I am very nervous for him. His breathing is also really really bad 24/7 despite being active. He is truly working on healthier habits and quitting smoking as of recent, but just wondering if these images are concerning and if he needs urgent attention.

Last Wednesday I had emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in my right fallopian tube.
In surgery they discovered a hole that connects my rectum, to my uterus? They said they can feel it from my rectum, and that they have no idea what it is or have seen it before, hence the title ""secret hole"" haha.

I was wondering if any of you have seen/heard of this before, and if this is something that needs to be investigated or followed up on? they didn't give me any other information other than ""hey we found this and we don't know what it is""

Need advice.,"I’m writing this because I’m honestly pretty shaken up and I’m not sure what to do.

Last night, I had a severe sleepwalking episode. In the dream/state I was in, I was convinced that my house was infested with some kind of monsters (maybe zombies? My memory is a bit blurry on the specifics).

Driven by absolute terror, I got out of bed and walked all the way to the balcony. The scary part is that I actually **found the key and unlocked the security grate/bars** to get out.

I ended up straddling the balustrade (railing), completely undecided on what to do. My plan in that state was either to try and climb down (which is impossible, I would have just fallen) or wait until I saw a monster appear at the door and then jump to escape.

I sat there on the railing for about a minute in this position. Slowly, I started to wake up and realize where I was. My adrenaline was through the roof. I managed to climb back in and go inside, but I was terrified.

**Context:**

* I am a 25-year-old male.
* I have only ever had one other sleepwalking episode in my life, but it was very minor and nothing comparable to this.

I was so close to my goal weight at around 50kg but then I went through a painful breakup from my first serious relationship AND I went on a 16 day vacation where I travelled to Vietnam and Japan. I indulged in a lot of foods and snacks at random times and when I wasnt even hungry in Japan, because I wanted to try so many new foods and I also always just had trouble being able to stop myself from eating when I was full or even being able to tell ir I was full or not anymore so I ended up overeating a lot and not checking in with my body. Considering what I was going through mentally with my breakup, I can def „forgive“ myself but it still sucks because I regained like 4-5kg back. Returning from the vacation was over a month ago and I still weigh 58-59kg so I did actually gain most of it back. It just sucks so so much because it like I lost most of my progress from 6 months in just 3 weeks? And what sucks even more is the fact that I now have pictures at my lowest weight where I still didn‘t feel satisfied and I wish I wouldve appreciated that body more and been more grateful for it but I wasnt. AND knowing that I could look like that and having now experienced what it felz like to be skinnier, losing it and now being back to my original body is so so weird because before my weight loss journey I had aways looked the way I looked and couldnt imagine anything else so I was, despite wanting to change, still not completely unhappy. I was dtill confident and loved myself a lot more than I do now, even though I technically weigh less. Does this make sense at all? Im really bad at explaining and english isnt my first language lmao. 

Since then Ive been maintaining my weight because I had to fix myself mentally first before approaching my weight loss journey a second time. And mentally outside of the weight loss thing I honestly have been improving a lot, I went through my personalized 30 day soft challenge where I tackled small habits that I wanted to have by the end of November and I was succesful with them like brushing my teeth 2x daily or drinking 2L of water daily. Im very proud of that and I think now Im ready to lose weight again. Im just kinda scared cause the past weeks Ive been kinda „out of control“ and eating a lot more than usual after having days where I accidently ate something that wasnt planned and so thus I havent weighef myself becaude Im scared of what the scale will say. Like that I gained 1-2kg extra in the last 1-2 weeks because last week was my birthday and the christmad market opened. I definitely recognize that I struggle with the all or nothing mindset and staying on track when I dont feel like it. I wish I wouldn‘t have regained back so much man, now I have to start all over again and go through another half a year because I plan on losing like 1kg a month, is that too slow? 

What makes this exciting though is the fact that I can go throigh another transformation and this time, I know how to tackle things a bit better than in my first weight loss. AND i met someone new who Im seeing and he met me in my current state where I dont feel comfortable or confident at all and hes so much more fit and slimmer than me loll but I kinda like that he met me where I am right now because what if I was slimmer thn this and then gained weight and he found m unattractive all out of a sudden

Damn this turned out to be a pretty long rant and if you read it all, thank you!! its my first time posting here and i felt inspired to also share my stuff after seeing others do as well. Is it normal to have phases in your weight loss journey where you gain a lot back?

Neighbor 27M 190lb

About 7 days ago I may have had an exposure to HIV. Recently I had to help a neighbor due to their dog biting him in the back of the leg. When I was assisting by applying a tourniquet, he was bleeding but not profusely and I do not remember any blood getting on me. Fast forward a couple of hours later, I noticed blood on my hangnail (bad habit of picking at it so it bleeds from time to time) and don’t remember if it was from me picking at it or his blood. Going back to the incident, after the encounter with said neighbor, I washed my hands maybe 30 minutes later but I don’t remember ever focusing on that hangnail.

The only way that blood could’ve possibly gotten on me was from the extension cord I used to tie his leg but I’m not 100% certain. I just know there’s no way he was actively bleeding on me because it was just his leg and I would’ve noticed more blood. I’m also assuming he has HIV, HepB, etc because you can never be 100% certain. I just always like being precautious and sometimes people don’t know what they have. 

Any thoughts?

On Thursday (thanksgiving) I had to leave work early to extreme stomach pain after drinking a soda that radiated from my stomach to my back. It caused me to visibly go pale especially around the lips. The pain would occur in waves where the pain was unbearable and it would be hard to breathe through the pain then it would dissipate. I kept trying to work through it but eventually i ended up rocking back and forth on the floor as that was the only thing that made the pain slightly better. My coworkers eventually found me and made me call my mom to drive me to the emergency room. By the time i got there the pain had mostly subsided as I had been dealing with this pain for several hours. They did a basic metabolic panel and a ct scan and everything came back normal. I was told they wished they could give me more answers but it’s probably a fluke or something viral and hopefully it doesn’t happen again.

And I apologies for mistakes made since I don't really know medical terms, I am trying to describe stuff as best as I can.

(I'm 15 male) On November 1st (Saturday night) I was playing basketball with my friends, and I don't really know how it happened since it was so quick and unexpected, as I was jumping to block the shot I somehow hit my finger (I think on his arm) while still going forwards and I'm not sure if I hit it straight on or it bent backwards.  
  
The area around my PIP joint on ring finger on right arm started to hurt. It got swollen and thickened. I went to the doctor and an hour later I got an X-ray done on my right hand. From top perspective and side (when he took the side profile I had to spread and rearrange my fingers so he could see them all separate). He said it wasn't broken and It would be healed by Monday (November 3rd). I had a stick under my finger and It was wrapped in a bandage (Which he said wasn't necessary but a nurse put it on and told me to have it) for the entire following week (from 3rd to 7th) for half a day.  
  
Now it's been 30 days since I've injured it, and It's still fatter than my ring finger on the other hand and I can't really apply pressure with it without it hurting (eg. hang from a bar) and I can't bend it properly inwards and outwards (elaborated below).  
  
(For inwards: There is a little space between the hand and the middle part of the finger which I can't get to touch and the finger hurts)  
(For outwards: I have really bendable fingers, I can bend the top part of my finger I think it's the DIP joint, backwards around 45° but after the injury I can bend it around 5°)

I have a cracking joints addiction and I've accidentally by muscle memory cracked this finger many times (MCP and DIP joint), I don't know if this has any negative effect to healing the finger. But I think I haven't cracked it the first week since most of the day it was covered in bandage.

My question is: If my finger is going to heal and be as good as it was before how long will it take, and what can I do to help it heal faster and better? Maybe some exercises?",,,,2025-12-01 00:00:22.731022+00,1,0,null,en,2,2025-11-30 21:08:55,20924,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1764536935,,,

I'm not sure what caused it. Initial symptoms were pain in the back of my neck when turning my head, which caused a shooting pain.

Today it's far worse. Constant debilitating pain across the back of my neck and shoulders, and almost a total inability to turn my head. It didn't respond to ibuprofen, but co-codamol takes the edge off for a few hours. Without painkillers the pain is a fairly severe ache, with shooting pains that make me cry out if I move the wrong way. The pain is non-localised, but centred on the base of my skull, and I have mild pain swallowing when not under the effect of painkillers. No numbness right now, and no real local tenderness.

I have a pharmacy around the corner where I can stock up on OTC painkillers, but how long do I give it before visiting my GP? Getting there might be difficult, as it's hard to turn my head at junctions!

Hey Reddit

Im after some advice on result blood tests. I’ve been experiencing appetite loss and weight loss for over a year now. Assumed it was stress with work and home life, but went to the doctors for a blood test. 

They called me back a few weeks ago and said I was low in vitamin D, but everything else was fine. I’ve not seen any link between weight loss and vitamin d deficiency? So, I looked on the NHS app.

Some of the other test results look a bit low, even if they’re within the allowed range? My immune system has been weak, and I’ve had tonsillitis twice, despite never having had it before, and UTIs where I bleed bright red, straight away. I’ve had more antibiotics last year than my previous 31 years combined.

On the 11th Nov, I noticed blood on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. I contacted my drs and they suggested it was due to hemorrhoids and to contact them again if it worsens or continues. 
I have always had an average of 2 bowel movements a week, I can't remember for how long, but that has been my normal for a long time now. I know I've not had a high fibre diet, so I have increased my fibre intake since then and took a slow acting laxative/fibre supplement on two occasions since then.

Every bowel movement I have had since the 11th (approx 6/7) has caused blood on the toilet paper. There is a little pain but not much. 
I have been drinking 1.5-2L of fluids (at least 50% water) a day, but I am not very mobile due to Fibromyalgia and severe back/leg pain.

My tonsils are swollen and sore. I can feel pressure build up, which feels very different from pressure caused by tonsil stones, in my tonsils. It is also very difficult to eat or drink as I’m having trouble swallowing, to the point where it’s caused me to choke every time I’m trying to eat.

\-wake up very early (4ish). when im on vacation/staying with friends i try to wake up about 2 hours before everyone else so i can finish my routine in peace before they wake up

\-get dressed, brush teeth. drink water and coffee. read at least 50 pages of a book.

\-poop (this is the hardest part because it's not directly in my control). most of the time it happens after coffee though.

\-when all that's done i can continue on with the rest of my day

In the vacation example, I will spend a lot of mental energy worrying about where my coffee is going to come from (is there a coffee machine? how doss it work? do i need to buy coffee? will i wake everyone else up when i make the coffee? what if someone else gets to it before me?) until it resolves itself.

I also struggle sometimes with cleanliness, health, and eating. But again, those are all good things. But I do get super anxious about random things, like yesterday I felt a bump in my mouth and worried for at least an hour that I had an std despite not having had unprotected sex ever in my life, or sex period in several months.

I like to check and recheck things. I'm currently looking for a new job so spend about 2 hours a day looking at different jobs, even though I have several months before my current contract even expires.

I also constantly seek reassurance. Whether it's by Googling things, asking people their opinions on things, or things like this very post.

I was once on a weekend trip with some friends. We were planning to take a bus ride back on the last day, and busses weren't running. I spent about an hour confirming that there were no busses, because we were expecting there to be. We had to stay an extra day and I started panicking because I hadn't planned for an extra day, didn't know if I had clean clothes, wasn't prepared to do my morning routine away from home again, etc. I started ranting about the lack of busses and my friend nicely suggested I might have ocd- she said I reminded her of a relative she has who is diagnosed with it.

  
I also set super high expectations of myself and get obsessed with things easily. My new year’s resolution this year was to run a 5k and I just ran a marathon.

i have no idea whats going on. i’ve had a uti twice before and this doesn’t feel like that (urine doesn’t smell, no pain during urination, no fever). not a kidney stone because my urine isn’t bloody and i’m not in enough pain. 

i’ve upped my water consumption to try to urinate more but it hasn’t made a difference.

My husband developed small red bites all over his body in the south. We avoided the beaches around dusk and dawn assuming they were sand fleas. 

The bites became increasingly itchy and localized on one leg and his abdomen. The red spots would come and go. This lasted almost 9 months and stayed itchy.

For the past month+, I’ve had near-constant headaches localized to a 1.5”-ish radius near my right temple. Sound and light don’t make it worse. 

 I have a pretty high pain tolerance but I’d rank them at around 4-5 on the pain scale, going up to 7-8ish if I strain, stand, or lay down. I tried Aspirin and Acetaminophen but they didn’t make a difference so I stopped taking them (don’t want a rebound headache). I have not sustained a head injury lol. 

A few days ago, I noticed my skull in that area is bulging slightly, the temple on the other side doesn’t do that. The bulge isn’t tender unless I press really hard. 

I’ve been having a few other weird symptoms but idk if they’re relevant (word loss- sometimes i know the word I want to say but I can’t say it. Other times it’s just blank, dizzy, random numbness, weirdly cranky but that might be from the pain). No fever but my lymph nodes are swollen i think

40m, recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. I decided to seek help after having lived the past four years in a very sedentary life style struggling to motivate myself to do basic chores, look after myself and stay focused on my job. I was diagnosed and recommended stimulants as the main course of action to resolve this.   
  
The problem is I have long suspected I have POTS and stimulants (I felt) may not be the best choice for me. I have been seeing a cardiologist recently and have performed the tilt test, 7 day holter monitor and catecholamine/serotonin test. Catecholamine test came back normal and still awaiting results of second test.

Holter test showed varying heart rate at rest between 45bpm - 143 bpm with the lower being during sleep and the higher being before bed. Average 81 BPM. When I wake in the morning my HR is around 60 but it will steadily climb as I get up and move around with big swings upon standing.

Tilt test showed HR of 75 lying raising to 115 upon standing with BP being 131-140 systolic throughout the 15 minute test. At home BP is usually around 103/75. 

My issue is that I have been prescribed ivabradine 2.5mg for 2 weeks increasing to 5mg after 2 weeks twice daily. My concern is that with a heart rate in the 40's during sleep I am concerned this may lead to bradycardia.

I have been taking propranolol as it helps with the adrenaline surges/ HR spikes and the anxiety that comes with that however it has been making me feel angry/depressed the following day and causes my sleep apnoea to become worse. During the course of a week my CPAP machine showed a 35% worsening of apnoea events. 

Seeing a sleep consultant, cardiologist and ADHD expect seems like each issue is being treated independent of the other which isn't really getting me to where I need to be. 

I'd like to be able to live my life, clean my house, stay focused on my career and enjoy going for a walk without feeling dizzy, anxious and having my heart rate skyrocket and result in laying on the sofa with a splitting headache. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed? I have read Guanfacine may address both the ADHD and POTS without negatively effecting my sleep apnoea.

Nobody knowing what is wrong with me. And constantly living in a poor condition mentally and physically. So, I decided to do something radical and get an extensive SPECT scan done. It's my last shot.

It started with severe body aches, sore throat, and headache. 4 days later I'm not getting any better, my chest and sinuses are extremely congested with no relief from extra hydration or decongestants. When I lay down it feels like my chest is being sat on. I'm not productively coughing up phlegm, but I am able to taste that it has a bitter, metallic taste which I've never experienced. When I cough it makes my lungs ache so bad and blowing my nose produces a dark green and bloody mucus. No fever, but I'm not someone who ever runs a fever no matter how sick I am. 

There are no urgent cares anywhere near me and I cannot get in with my doctor until my appointment on Dec. 2nd for a completely unrelated but serious issue. My only option for medical care right now is our level 3 emergency department. Does this sound like something that would warrant a trip to the ED this evening or should I wait until I see my doctor on the 2nd?

How can i find out the root cause of brainfog?","Hello. I’m 18, male. I’m coming to you with a question and asking for help.

In 2019, during the first wave of COVID, I got COVID. Before that, the only health issue I had was mild OCD that appeared rarely and was related to religious topics, but it didn’t really bother me. After I had COVID, I developed all the symptoms I describe below.

At the moment I have: brain fog, depersonalization and derealization, depression((I'm sure I have depression, but I'm not sure if it arose from stress caused by Covid and brain fog or if it is the cause of them.)), blurry vision, severe OCD, forgetfulness (possibly related to OCD), bags under my eyes. Because of all this, sometimes it’s hard for me to walk — I walk unsteadily and sometimes lose balance, swaying from side to side. One of the important symptoms is sleepiness/fatigue that never goes away. Sometimes I think how great I would feel if I just wasn’t this exhausted. So far, I’ve only managed to slightly reduce this fatigue by waking up early — on these days I feel a bit more energetic.

I also want to say that right after COVID my OCD suddenly became much stronger and started interfering with everything I did, not letting me live normally, even though I didn’t feel any fear during the pandemic. That’s why I tend to think COVID did something biochemical(maybe its depression) that could have worsened the OCD. Perhaps this is neuroinflammation that has somehow persisted for 5 years.

I read an article on selfhack.com that said these conditions go hand in hand because of limbic system exhaustion, and that if a person was fine before a viral infection, then the infection is most likely the cause. But I don’t understand how to find the real reason and cure it, because depression feels like the last thing I’m able to “check.” So I’m asking you to help me figure this out.

What’s interesting is that I rarely get short moments of partial clarity lasting about 15 minutes. During these moments, my vision becomes normal, I start realizing where I am and what I’m seeing in front of me, and movements that usually feel strange and sharp become smooth and I can actually feel them. My gait becomes more confident because I start feeling the ground under my feet. These clarity episodes have different triggers: sometimes it happens from Ginkgo biloba, other times during a walk, a couple of times after coffee. Once, they took three tubes of blood for several tests, and after about two and a half hours I had a clarity episode that lasted a few minutes. Can this happen simply during post-COVID depression?

P.s. One person on reddit said it might be a kind of placebo from the body when you try something stimulating for the first time or after a long break, but it still might be worth paying attention to these things.


Here is what I have already tried:
MRI of the brain, duplex ultrasound of the neck vessels, many blood tests (clotting, viscosity, inflammatory markers, erythrocytes, important vitamins, testosterone, folic acid, cortisol, important vitamins, etc.), thyroid hormones, an oxygen saturation test (the fingertip one). Everything was normal.

I took: glycine, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, Mexidol, ribose capsules, magnesium.
• I received 10-day courses of Cerebrolysin IV twice.

• For a long time I had a deviated nasal septum, so I had surgery a month ago.

• I tried the keto diet, then water fasting for two days. There was no improvement.

None of this helped, except for partial improvements from Cerebrolysin, Ginkgo biloba, Zoloft, and Mexidol.

31868,reddit.com,t3_1pasf9z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pasf9z,Welcome to the Cupcake Club Method!,"Hear me out before thinking I'm nuts!  Explanations at the bottom.  I'm a biologist and lab researcher so there is a justification for the rules.  

Here are the hard rules of the Cupcake Club Method!  

Rule #1, you don't talk about Cupcake Club. ;)
Rule#2,  all members of Cupcake club go and buy 2 trays of chocolate mini cupcakes with chocolate frosting (12 packs).  If caught with vanilla you will be asked to leave the CC.  
Rule #3,  reprogram your CGM to an alarm of 75mg.  
Rule #4, If your CGM alerts at 75, you eat 1 mini cc.  
Rule #5,  if your CGM reaches 70, you eat 1 mini cc.  
Rule #6, if your CGM reaches 65, you eat 1 mini cc.  
Rule #7,  if your CGM reaches 60, you do nothing. You have reached the 3 C.C. hard stop.  
Rule #8,  if your CGM reaches 55, you then switch back to the default which is dextrose powder or glucose tabs, NOTHING but those 2. No table sugar, no juice etc only D or G.  
Rule #9,  you take 1 Cupcake before triggers.  I take one before a hot shower, before walks, before going outside in the heat.  Whatever your triggers are you take 1 mini cupcake before it.  (If cgm is at &lt;110)
Rule #10 you work on timing, learn your body and how fast your drops and recoveries are and make slight course corrections.   

Now onto the whys and the back story of the Cupcake method.  I have been searching for a year for the best hacks for hypoglycemia.  I have methodically tested dozens of things.  I went from 30+ hypoglycemic episodes per day, down to 1-3 per week.   I'm using Retatrutide plus high dose diazoxide and still have some breakthroughs.  This method ended those final annoying breakthroughs that hit you hard. 

Why.  
Dextrose and glucose works good to push you up quick but not keep you up.  Sugar and OJ take too long, bounce you too high, and stay for too long.  Slim Jim's work somewhat for stability but take too long.  Acrobose, cornstarch, and glycosade help to stabilize only a small amount and are not for acute episodes.  
The mini Cupcake is the correct amount of carbs, fats, proteins, dextrose, sucrose, and fructose.  Each of those plays a unique role in the CCM. 

Fat + cocoa+ protein slow absorption and gastric emptying, stretches the glucose curve out so you don’t rebound low afterward and still allow the quick acting carbs to already start working.  

Disclaimer:
This is a preventative routine and NOT an emergency action plan.  The purpose of the CCM is to prevent lows, not treat them.  The alert levels must be followed and it works with chocolate mini cupcakes only as they have the correct amount of each element.  This works for ME, but every body is different.  I'm not saying its for you, but id still give it a week and see. I would love to hear feedback if you try it. Theres more science behind it but I'm keeping this surface level so its an easily implemented and fun strategy.  

Hope this helps you too!  Membership is now open!

She is unfortunately struggling to get solid support from her healthcare provider. I am looking to understand as much as I can to make sure we are making the most informed decisions possible.

  
**Some context:**

She is in her 70s and does not yet have any continuous glucose monitor (CGM), so she is routinely pricking her finger many times (10+) a day as she learns to manage her diet appropriately. She has some glucose tablets as well that she uses if her blood sugar drops below 80, which seems like is around where she starts to feel a little dizzy or light-headed.

She is trying to be very cautious about what she eats, but after meals with some (non-simple or refined) carbohydrates (limited to 1/4 cup/meal) she still has some blood sugar dips. 

  
**Questions:**

1. She is working with her doctor to try and understand the cause, but in the meantime is looking to get a CGM. From what I've gathered so far, Dexcom G6/G7 seems to be what we should be after. Is this the right way to go?
2. Currently she is avoiding food about 4 hours before bed and seems to have positive results. I am getting mixed opinions on whether or not this is good. On one hand, a low glycemic index, slow digesting carb, seems like it would make sure blood sugar stays good throughout the night. On the other, until we have solid predictability, it sounds dangerous to eat anything. Does it sound safe for her to continue to have a significant fasting window before bed? I was not too hapy to find recently 3 hours after breakfast her blood sugar was down to \~70. I did confirm with her what she ate, and it wasn't the best choice - some kind of healthy-oritented muffin that had a few ingredients considered ""medium"" glycemic index, and coffee w/ milk (that part should be OK?)
3. My understanding is that glucose tablets **do not** affect insulin production and is safe to take them when it is low. And while sugary drinks may temporarily resolve low blood sugar, they will trigger another crash, specifically because this is reactive hypoglycemia. Does this sound accurate?
4. Are thre any good resources for learning more about this topic that can help with making better decisions? I have a general understanding of the mechanisms behind reactive hypoglycemia but would be happy to learn more. Technical is OK. I am not a medical professional but I am in STEM and have research experience.

I also started a new job 4 months ago, and the constant pressure and adjustment haven’t helped. 

I worked out occasionally — kickboxing, jogging, yoga — but nowhere near as consistently as I wanted to. 

I had hoped to lose around 2 kg before December 1st; instead, I gained at least 2… maybe more. I’m honestly too scared to even step on the scale right now. 

I keep worrying that I’m going to gain everything back. I keep catching myself thinking things like: “Well, today is already ruined, might as well keep eating,” or the classic “I didn’t lose my 40 kg in a month, so I won’t gain them back in 40 months either — I can have another chocolate.” 

On the plus side, I'm still tracking everything I eat. 

Now Christmas season is coming up, which makes it hard to maintain anyway, and I just feel like I completely let myself down, even though I know the stress and circumstances were real and heavy.

It always feels forced to me, I do it with zero joy. Time there goes so slowly, I feel bored, wishing I could get home faster and just chill. Going to the gym after a hard day at work feels even worse. I feel like it’s a waste of time, time I could spend at home relaxing and doing what I actually enjoy, like gaming. How do people go daily and actually enjoy it? I see so many of the same faces there every day.

My experience with gym and weight loss has been full of ups and downs over the past decade. I’m just not motivated, and often I end up eating junk food anyway since regular food gives me no pleasure. In the past, I lost about 60 kg in a few months when I was motivated for certain reasons. Then the motivation disappeared, and I gained it all back. I lost some weight again, and gained it back, got diagnosed with risk hepatitis, lost 20 kg, held that weight for a while, and then gained it back again. I got a personal trainer and lost about 15 kg in 2 months, but gained it back after the sessions ended, I can’t afford to pay someone 500 euros every month to keep monitoring me.

I’ve moved to a new country, a new place, a new environment, and I thought maybe I’d try the gym again. But I feel like it’s just going to end up a disaster again, a waste of money and time.

Lifting more, heavier than I ever have, eating in a deficit, etc. I have lost weight but my body is still adjusting. This past Thanksgiving we were over at their house. I wasn’t tracking calories, wasn’t talking about weight loss, I stopped posting about my “journey” as well due to their rude comments. But that did not stop them. They started commenting “you know, you look so good, but you’re getting REALLY thin, it’s almost TOO thin!” Mind you, I’m 5ft5in, 190lbs, definitely still have a long way to my goal and DEFINITELY am not “too thin”. This is family so how do I respond? Both women are morbidly obese. I don’t wanna be rude and say “you’re looking too fat” but honestly I’m not the only one about to be uncomfortable all the time. How would you all handle this? 

SIDE NOTE: my husband is amazing at telling them they take their comments too far, he wasn’t here for this interaction but know that he usually is 110% backing me up.

I started this journey in March, and today I stepped on the scale and saw that I weigh 90,9kg / 200.4lbs. Realizing while converting to lbs that I'm also almost under 200lbs too, that's crazy. That has been my lowest weight in years !

I'm almost not obese anymore, need to lose another 5kg / 11lbs and I'll only be overweight !! (I'm 1m68 / 5'5). And I'll be able to see my sleep doctor and see if I still need my CPAP.

I started to wear jeans again. Denim jeans !! I haven't wore that in years, because it was too hard to find jeans that would fit, I never found my size so I would wear shorts or cargo pants. I wear jeans all the time now. I don't huff and puff, I'm not scared of stairs anymore. Everything is so much better. I feel so much better. I love my face, I'm not so round and puffy anymore.

For context I was a FULLY sedentary person before starting my journey.I got into an accident that messed up both my meniscus and ACL, had depression, etc. Basically one thing led to another and I was spending basically the entire day laying down in bed, except for two or three 5 hour shifts I would do at work. This caused me to gain almost 40 pounds, plus I was already in the obese category as it is. 

Needles to say, calorie counting became my savior. It really would be an understatement to say it saved my life. I have lost around 38 pounds, and it has been such a huge improvement in so many aspects of my life. There’s less of a burden on my knees so I can exercise a couple of times a week. My mental health, while still a struggle here and there, is significantly better. I have hope for the future because I am seeing progress. Additionally, I have diagnosed BED, so calorie counting is the only thing that keeps me accountable. Having a streak on the days I count and seeing the numbers motivates me so much.

I recently read an article on scheduled diet breaks and how they can be beneficial for both your metabolism and mental health during a diet. While I don’t necessarily see what I am doing as a diet and rather as a lifestyle change, I decided to follow what the article suggested and at day 90 of my diet, which happened to land on the weekend before thanksgiving, to do 14 days at maintenance calories. Well…7 days in and I feel absolutely awful. Eating at maintenance has made me feel absolutely disgusting. It doesn’t help that I am visiting family for the holidays, and we have been eating out nearly every day (I had only eaten out around 2 or 3 times since I started my calorie counting 3 months ago). The family that I am visiting also in general does not partake in the healthiest of eating habits, and so basically I am 2500 calories over my budget (I set my maintenance at 1700 to give myself a margin of error, as the TDEE calculator says it’s ~2000). I am supposed to eat at maintenance for 7 more days, but this has just been making me extremely upset and all I want is to go home and “make up” for all the calories I overate, or work them off. While I understand maintenance and diet breaks are important I feel so so scared to lose my progress. Today I even had a small binge eating episode, which was bad because there were no healthy food options where I am staying so it consisted of a couple press and marshmallows, yet still accrued around 500 calories. 

I guess what I am saying is, I really don’t know whether I should continue my maintenance break or go back to my deficit, and try the maintenance break thing again maybe in 45 days or something. Especially because i’m supposed to come back here for Christmas and I feel like my control is slipping. I am resenting maintenance and all the self love I had been building up these past few months is leaving me. In fact, i’m not even sure if I should schedule a “diet break” again or if I should just wait to actually plateau next time before trying it. I had been losing weight pretty consistently before this starting maintenance. I will say I have not weighted myself since starting, although I do expect the scale to go up a couple of pounds because of water weight. I’m not sure if this week will actually make me gain weight considering the past two weeks i was at least 2000 calories under budget each week (i really do track extremely religiously, if anything I overestimate all of my calories). But the main problem still is that this break really is messing with my self image and my control. 

i’m sorry if this all sounds totally like im rambling. English is not my first language and I can’t really talk to many people around me about this because they’re not the most supportive about weight loss.

31833,reddit.com,t3_1pafm3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1pafm3c/update_to_my_weight_loss_journey/,Update to My Weight Loss Journey.,"**Where I Am**

Since I started my weight loss journey, my interest in powerlifting has spiked, and I’ve made significant gains in that area. At the same time, I’ve had to fight through some challenges related to weight loss, especially a lack of energy. Even though I’ve focused on keeping my protein and carbs high, I still feel that I don’t have the same explosive energy I had at the beginning. My strength has increased, but it’s always an uphill battle to maintain the energy needed to keep adding weight to the bar.

**What I Have Accomplished**

In late June, when I began this journey, I weighed 163.7 kg (370 lbs). As of now, I’ve lost 18.5 kg (41 lbs), which is exactly where I expected to be with a 1k deficit. Looking ahead, I’m planning to compete in a beginner powerlifting competition next October. My goal is to lift a total of 550 kg (1,200 lbs+) while weighing in at 120 kg (265 lbs).

**What Has Been a Challenge**

Right now, I’m facing a two-pronged challenge. My mental health has generally been good, but I’ve noticed some hormone fluctuations that sometimes leave me feeling depressed or moody if I don’t meet my expectations. The other challenge is the energy loss I mentioned earlier. Together, these two issues make things tough, when I expect myself to lift heavier or lose more weight and it doesn’t happen, I get more emotional than I used to, almost like being a teenager again haha.

**What I’m Doing Now**

After some serious talks with my trainer, my wife, and reflecting on my previous posts about mental crashes, I’ve decided to take a two-week maintenance break. During this time, weight loss won’t be my primary target, I just want to avoid gaining fat. The plan is that more calories will help both my energy levels and my mood.

I had originally set a goal of losing 20 kg (44 lbs) before Christmas, but I won’t be hitting that mark and that’s intentional, so it’s not a big deal. I’ll start the diet break on December 15th and return to my deficit on January 2nd. I won’t jump straight to maintenance calories instead, I’ll increase by 500 calories for the first week, then move to full maintenance in the second week. Over the holidays, I’ll keep an eye on my weight to make sure I don’t gain significantly.

**What I’ve Learned**

We’re not robots, you can’t just set values in a config file and expect everything to run smoothly forever. If you overdo it, things will eventually crack. Be reasonable with yourself. You don’t need to stay at a high deficit for the entire journey, it’s okay to slow down sometimes.

I’m a very dedicated person, and once I decide on something, it’s hard for me to change course. But right now, that dedication is more of a weakness than a strength, because mental health is just as important as physical health.

That’s all for now. Feel free to share your own journey with me, I’ll be answering questions and comments.

I recently went to urgent care because of this weird feeling in my throat. It feels like I have a lump in my throat. It’s scary because it feels like my throat is closing. They did blood work and told me that I have Lyme disease and prescribed me doxycycline 100 mg for two weeks. 

I’ve been taking the doxycycline for two days now but this throat feeling is getting worse. I’m scared because I don’t know if this is just an uncomfortable sensation or if something is actually wrong. 

Additionally, I also have Crohn’s disease. I haven’t taken any medication for it in a while though. I’m not sure if that plays a factor in this at all. I also noticed some blue spots that appear on my fingers occasionally as of a month ago. My dad said it’s probably Reynauds. Also don’t know if this plays a factor

I generally don't eat anything the first 2/3 of my day, except for occasionally coffee when I first wake up. I only eat a full meal eventually because I realize I haven't eaten anything substantive during the day so I should have a meal(typically dinner.) but what happens after that is I feel hungry 2-3 hours after, which ends up being the first time of the day I feel hungry.

Now, I know the most reasonable explanation for the lack of hunger is that I'm on Ozempic and it's supposed to do that and I didn't start experiencing the lack of hunger until I started on it. But it's strange to me that I'd feel hunger soon after eating and not at any other time. Is this expected on Ozempic or is this unusual and could be caused by something else?

If relevant, here are my other meds: Estradiol, Progesterone, Bicalutamide, atomoxetine, hydroxyzine, and lamotogrine. I also take multivitamins and hair, skin, nail supplements.

I noticed bilateral bumps above my collarbones back in August. They were so small at the time, I thought it was muscle. Come October and they’ve grown, and they continued to grow to the point where I was fairly certain they were lymph nodes.

I go to the university health clinic, doc orders an ultrasound that comes back as “probable benign reactive” smth smth lymph nodes. Multiple on each side, biggest 1.4cm. Results didn’t describe their structure. Between my appointment and my ultrasound (early November), more developed on my neck. This week, I’ve felt even more, and then ones that developed earlier this month are much bigger. The collarbone ones aren’t noticeably any bigger, but never got any smaller.

Painless, hard, but moveable. I wasn’t sick before I got the collarbone ones, but both times I noticed new ones I was sick, but they never went away after I recovered, they just got bigger. Wondering if the timing is just a coincidence.

I do get lymph nodes occasionally when I’m sick, but they’ve always been tender and soft before, never like this or “spreading.”

Got an appointment with my PCP for December when I’m back for break, but I’m wondering what this possibly could be? Had severe fatigue back in the summer and had a bunch of bloodwork that ruled out any autoimmune concerns.

Basically, there’s been about four times in the span of a month and a half where I’ve felt lymph nodes that I’m 80% certain weren’t there the last time I had checked. Mono test was negative.

I’m writing about my spouse. 32M, normally healthy as a horse, and doesn’t take any prescription meds or have any relevant medical history. He has had a strange illness that we’re pretty sure is HFMD, but urgent care was not helpful (more on that below), so we still have questions. Here is history of his illness progression:

His symptoms started on Tuesday and initial symptoms were a 100-101 fever that wouldn’t break for 12+ hours, fatigue, chills, aches, loss of appetite, and nausea. He had these symptoms for 2 days. He mentioned a sore throat and congestion on day 2. On day 3, his  fever broke for good, but he woke up to itchy red bumps ALL OVER his hands. The Bumps are on the palms of his hands and all over his fingers. He also noticed some small bumps in his throat (throat pain) and around his mouth. He is so miserable. I’ve been trying to nurse him back to health. I’ve given him Ibuprofen, Benadryl, and he’s tried various creams (Hydrocortisone; Benadryl itch cream) with little success. The only things that have seemed to help are the Ibuprofen and 1% colloidal oatmeal cream. 
He went to urgent care on day 3 of illness/day 1 of bumps, and all they did was give him a strep test (negative) and tell him to drink herbal tea (?), overly focusing on the sore throat symptom and not even addressing the angry red bumps covering his hands 😬. He said that the PA didn’t even talk to him except to say that the strep test was negative. On Friday (day 2 of bumps), he developed more bumps and found some big painful ones on his elbow and on his feet (mainly on the heel, but there’s a few on the bottom of his toes too).

Anyway, we have questions. The bumps started on Thursday, so he is about to enter day 4 of bumps/day 6 (I think) of overall illness. His remaining symptoms are: still a bit fatigued/general malaise, sore throat, and he’s experiencing pain from the bumps but no longer itching. 
1. He has been somewhat quarantining and we’ve been trying to distance from one another (throwback to the early pandemic days of ~social distancing~ 😅). How long is he contagious for?When will it be safe for him to return to work in person/go out in public/ us to touch each other again? 
2. I’m very worried about catching it because I know that HFMD is highly contagious, and I’m also somewhat medically fragile (lots of chronic illnesses + currently taking an immunosuppressant). I miraculously haven’t caught it yet, so I wonder if I’m in the clear?
3. How long will it take the bumps to go away? Is there anything else he can do to alleviate symptoms?
4. No one can really answer this question, but feel free to speculate. We’re wondering how on earth he even caught this illness when we don’t have kids and aren’t really ever around kids? 

Thanks so much for any insight!

HISTORY- I have been told by medical professionals in family medicine clinics to try Neosporin, Vaseline, and olive oil I have tried lotion, carmex lip balm, coconut oil, have been prescribed Ciprodex drops.  Each time the condition did not improve at all or returned shortly after.

I was using the end of a fluffed up swab to mop up the liquid in my ear one time and it was black followed by a black soot like dust so I assumed it was fungal. I threw out my earphones and stopped using them all together and I had spread it to my other ear and my scalp from itching it in my sleep. l tried Clotrimazole cream, Tolnaftate liquid, they gave relief but only for a few hours.  The spot on my scalp ended up growing to a 3"" wide circle.

I found a random ointment online ""draw salve"" that was tea tree oil based that eased my itching so I kept using it for months, it took a long time but it killed the fungus everywhere but that original ear and when it came back I spread it to my face from itching in my sleep. 

I finally decided to try an ENT, who was quite rude and told me the fungus was not my problem and insisted instead that its a ""mental disorder causing me to compulsively scratch it"" and said antifungal wouldn't help even though I was able to heal the other ear and that I was ""being ridiculous"" for worrying that it will spread because my immune system would fight it off. 

He prescribed me clotrimazole drops and I asked about an oral antifungal so he added fluconazole tablets ""to make me happy"" but also a steroid mometasone furoate and told me to take them for a month solid.  It came back again after a few weeks from stopping.  

I tried terbinafine hydrochloride when I found a different cream, (i don't have a perforation) but it is acting like the other OTC creams I tried in the past.  Each time I used the medications as directed, I tried using them two weeks longer than it said, I tried waiting a week and using it for a week again as recommended by a pharmacist, it always returns within 3-6 weeks. I started covering my ear with a thin fabric headband so I couldn't scratch it in my sleep so it is just one small spot on my face and my ear currently but it is getting intense. 

I do not want to go to the same ENT again but I am unsure if I should go to a different ENT or would a dermatologist be able to help me more?

I asked them to consult trauma again before discharge because I did not think that, in the setting of trauma and then not even looking at my spleen, that the fluid was normal. My Hgb was also declining but they gave me a lot of fluids and it stayed stable. It was around 12.9 at d/c and my BP was lower than normal but my map stayed above 65. I was also taking pain meds around the clock. I see my PCP in a few days and will get my hgb rechecked then but I’m wondering if I should get a second opinion about the free fluid in my pelvis?

Some of them used to pop in a hot shower, but now the bumps grow deeper under the skin, feel huge, and hurt a lot. I’m also prone to keloids, so the old ones never really go away and it makes me insecure. I don’t shave often because every time I do, the bumps come back bigger and more painful.

This year I started getting spots where the skin feels “split” or raw, especially after a pimple has drained. They hurt when my thighs rub together, so walking becomes painful. Sometimes I can’t wear underwear because the area bleeds and the fabric sticks to it. I’ve had to use large pimple patches just to function.

Here’s all the context that might be relevant:

20F university student.

Dx: MDD, OCD, ADD

Rx: 50mg spironolactone, 20mg Vyvanse, 300mg Wellbutrin, 100mg Zoloft (just increased from 50mg), 0.25mg Rexulti (just added)

Hx of DRESS syndrome and subsequent long-term EBV infection (~1.5 years ago, not caused by psych medication), hypersomnolence, some self-harm in childhood (in remission for 8 years), NO suicidal ideation or substance abuse

Supplements: women’s multivitamin, fish oil capsules, cranberry concentrate

I recently had a med management appointment with my psychiatrist where I had assumed she wouldn’t make any changes, since from my POV I thought I was stable and doing relatively well compared to when I first started seeing her last spring (which was during a severe depressive episode that caused me to withdraw from school for the remainder of the semester). However, I mentioned that my OCD seemed to have shifted away from contamination-related compulsions (which used to be my main issue and reason for diagnosis) towards a bit of hoarding-type behaviour (collecting cans next to my bed). This seemed to really concern my doc, who said she now considers my OCD to be moderate to severe where she has previously characterized it as mild. This was a bit of a shock to me, since I actually feel generally more functional than when I was deep in my contamination obsession because of how much of a time sink it was, even though I acknowledge that the hoarding is probably “weirder” and a little more out of character for me. 

Anywho, my doc then decided to bump my Zoloft from 50mg to 100mg and add 0.25mg Rexulti. She didn’t really explain very much about the Rexulti, so it was only when I looked it up after my appointment that I realized it was an antipsychotic. That was a little surprising to me, but I do know antipsychotics are prescribed for all kinds of things that aren’t psychosis. If it’ll help, I don’t care what class of meds it’s technically in. However, I’m really worried about the potential side effects and it’s keeping me from starting it. 

The potential weight gain and drowsiness keep coming up in all the literature I’m reading as well as patient experiences. This is the first time in my life since childhood that my body and weight aren’t causing me a lot of distress or insecurity, so the idea of experiencing a large weight fluctuation is really, really stressing me out. Because Rexulti can change metabolism itself on top of just increasing appetite, I’ve seen people say that even with decent diet and exercise they’ve gained a significant amount. I’m a college student who doesn’t personally have a lot of bandwidth for cooking and working out, so I’m pretty sedentary and my diet is admittedly pretty bad. So far I’ve more or less gotten away with it and remained 115ish lbs, but that’s probably just because my Vyvanse and Wellbutrin are keeping my appetite low enough that the junk isn’t actually putting me in a surplus. I don’t think I’m in a place in my life where I’ll be able to quickly overhaul my habits, so I feel like I am SCREWED if I start Rexulti. How likely am I to experience this side effect at 0.25mg? Is there a realistic way to mitigate it or is it just a necessary evil of antipsychotics?

The sleepiness also really worries me. I had a huge issue with anhedonia and excessive sleepiness that majorly contributed to past academic struggles. It only JUST started to get better a few months ago when I went up to 300mg of Wellbutrin. I am scared that the combination of upping my Zoloft (which definitely makes me more tired) and adding Rexulti will undo all my progress. How worried should I be about this? Again, could I realistically mitigate this side effect? I absolutely cannot afford to have another poor semester, my mental health and low energy have already caused me to bomb my last two semesters. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I’ve found it hard to find very specific info about extent and prevalence of side effects and I know that bad experiences are often overrepresented in patient anecdotes shared online. I want to try this med if it has the potential to help, but all the information I’m finding is leading me to believe the side effects will negatively affect my mental health more than the drug will help it.

My mother(64 years old) has been suffering from chronic headaches for the past 3-4 years. We have tried numerous neuros and specialists, but the comfort is not there. We have run multiple MRIs as well, and there seems to be nothing wrong with her.

Currently, we are consulting one of the well-reputed neuros from Mumbai, and she has prescribed *Divalproex and Amitriptyline (10mg) + Propranolol (40mg)*. All these are to provide relief from migraines, nerve pain, and anxiety I suppose. Earlier, she was on *Escitalopram (SSRI antidepressant) + Clonazepam (benzodiazepine)* for a couple of years.

All this is not giving her relief at all, and she has fallen into the dark pit of overthinking and anxiety. She was extremely restless yesterday and urged us to take her to the hospital. We took her to the hospital, redid the MRIs, ECG, and other vitals. Everything was perfectly normal. 

A physician there gave her *clonazepam 0.5 mg* under the tongue, and she was okay within an hour. But her situation is more or less the same this morning.

Some doctors are suggesting this is a psychological issue, and we are thinking of consulting with a psychiatrist after consulting with our current neuro.

It is really hampering her quality of life, and as a family, we are also facing a lot of trouble. Any expert opinion or advice! Anything, absolutely anything would help at this point in time!

I served 8 years in the military then spent 9 more with the state police(I had dozens of concussions several were severe and earned me a night in the hospital) and was working through some of my own issues when this happened and combined it left me mentally destroyed. After many forms of treatment without improvement I turned to large amounts of opioids, Adderall and benzodiazepines for relief. 
Two years later I was a passenger in a rollover but was fine aside from the normal aches pains and a headache. A few hours later I’m walking my dog when I feel dizzy then the next thing I remember is being in the ambulance. It was diagnosed that I had a grand maul seizure for around 4 minutes and spent 4 days in the hospital. 
Six months later I had been taking a bit of extra adderall to keep up with life. Then one day I felt that woozy headed floppy leg feeling and again woke up in an ambulance. This seizure lasted around 9 minutes and in the fall I broke my shoulder blade but the seizure its self apparently did no damage. Doctor explained the risks of seizures with adderall and it was my wake up call. 
I found healthier ways to cope with my problems and doctors more qualified in working with basket cases like myself. Then around a year or so ago I started noticing new issues like short term memory loss, twitching, loss of dexterity, problems sleeping and such. 
Two months ago it felt like all those issues and more seemed to doubled overnight with my ability to balance and motor functions noticeably less like dropping things and writing becoming difficult with mood swings. My short term memory is really bad but what most concerns me is my long term memory or lack there of. I have very little to no memory for long periods of my life and not little things like my own wedding or I forgot my birthday an entire day and other major milestone that anyone should have some memory of. But of course I remember every second of the bad memories. 
Could this be damage caused by those seizures that’s just taken time before getting to work and is that actually possible or just google ai crap? Brain worms maybe? Or something more realistic. 
Despite everything I was sober and quite fit weight lifting and going on long hikes and hunts in the mountains. I eat well and until recent months I was fit and healthy. But I had not had a check up since the last seizure and with the waiting list I just saw my doctor a few days ago. She didn’t explain a lot but ordered a ton of test and referrals.
