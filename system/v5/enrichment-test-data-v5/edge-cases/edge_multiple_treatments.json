  "text": "Sharing my experience managing post-bariatric hypoglycemia for anyone newly diagnosed. Started with dietary modifications - small frequent meals, protein first, avoiding simple carbs. That helped but wasn't enough. Doctor added acarbose which made a difference. Also tried octreotide injections for a while but the side effects weren't worth it. Now using a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) to track patterns and it's been a game changer. Recently started diazoxide and it's helping with the severe drops. Still carrying glucose tablets everywhere just in case.",
