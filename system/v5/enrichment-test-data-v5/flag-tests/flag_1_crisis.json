  "text": "I'm 10 months post-gastric bypass and my post-bariatric hypoglycemia is destroying my life. I can't work, can't drive, can't do anything normal. The constant fear of passing out is paralyzing. I've tried everything - dietary changes, acarbose, continuous glucose monitoring - nothing helps enough. I feel trapped in my own body. I honestly don't know how much longer I can keep living like this. I just want it to stop. I can't see a way forward anymore.",
