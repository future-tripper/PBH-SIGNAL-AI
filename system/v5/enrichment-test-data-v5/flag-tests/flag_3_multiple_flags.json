  "text": "I've been diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia after my gastric sleeve 6 months ago. My doctor started me on avexitide 2 weeks ago and after my doses I'm getting worse - severe shakiness, dizziness, and nausea within an hour of taking it. But I'm wondering if my original diagnosis was even right? I never got formally tested for PBH, just reactive hypo. Should hypoglycemia after bariatric surgery automatically be called PBH or is that different? Confused and feeling awful from this medication.",
