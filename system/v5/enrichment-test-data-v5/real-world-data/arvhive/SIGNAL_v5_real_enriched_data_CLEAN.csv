31321,reddit.com,t3_1p6y76x,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1p6y76x/back_in_my_healthy_bmi_range_goal_weight/,Back in my healthy BMI range! Goal weight ✅,"A year ago, I was at my highest weight ever. I shattered my foot in early 2024, and shortly after accepted a temp job with 70-80 hour work weeks and a crazy drinking culture. Not being able to walk or exercise totally wrecked me.

I’m 5’3”, weighed at least 180 pounds (possibly 19x, the scale terrified me.) But a few weeks before surgery, I decided to start cycling. 

I made a choice that I wanted to get into the best shape of my life. And a year later, I’m here! 

What worked for me: 

I travel a LOT, I’ve moved four times this year, and there’s really no exact workout I could do consistently. 

Instead, I did what I could when I could — I love planks and body weight arm workouts, I cycle and lift weights when I have a gym, and I have loved learning to walk correctly again and starting to run.

I didn’t calorie count initially, but went to 1,600 and then 1,200 when I dialed in. When I travel, I don’t track, but I’ve gotten a lot better at intuitive eating and listening to my body. If I go on vacation and overeat, I go to 1600 and then 1,200 calories for a week or two after, If I find myself under-eating, I drink protein shakes, go out to eat, or ease up on my diet with a maintenance period. 

The hard parts:

Petite girls can’t lose very fast (healthy deficit is smaller), I take two appetite-increasing medications, and I couldn’t “just walk.” 

It worked for me to deficit harder during the day and eat more at night for a while, and then to switch to one alternative med two months ago. I focused on lifestyle, not fads, and really honed in on healthier eating habits without killing the fun times. 

The best parts:

I ate pizza, drank wine, enjoyed happy hours and traveled. I am happy I lost 43 pounds in 11 months instead of losing more and enjoying less.

I feel so much better every day.  Before I broke my foot, I was 10-15 pounds overweight and not active. Ultimately, I think this led me to a more balanced existence. Working out also helps a lot with my impulse control! 

Also, maintenance periods are so important! Take breaks and come back to weight loss! 

Now that I’ve hit my initial goal weight, I’m excited to get down to the mid range of my BMI and start building muscle! 

TLDR: 

Made it to my goal weight by focusing on workouts I like, maintaining when I felt tired, and doing what fit my ever-changing lifestyle.

Last year I went from looking fat to now looking like normal overweight. I began going to a dietician, and told me to go to 3000kcal so that I would hit a calorie deficit. I disagreed and went with 2700kcal on weekdays, and 3000kcal in the weekend.

I have a very good diet, hitting my macros and staying on (now) 2600kcal. I exercise 5 times a week. This consists of 2/3 days basketball and 2/3 days gym. 

Last 4 months or so I have been the same weight, but see very little changes in my body, like seeing a couple more veins, or seeing my muscles pop a bit more. Last weigh in with the dietician, I was 22% body fat.

Does anybody have tips to lose the weight more, while still having the muscle?

Just started Claritin (trailing it), take Ativan as needed, 15mg-30mg of cbd daily, occasional alcohol, very very occasional thc, no smoking. 

I’ve had a horrible few months, super high anxiety over all of this, I’m curious if it’s all because of my sinuses - and if that’s a possibility, would antibiotics even do anything at this point? 

August - noticed light sensitivity on and off, chalked it up to needing a new glasses prescription (I did need one)

September - not as often light sensitivity but still there, towards the end of the month I got a super bad day of vertigo. By the end of that day I ended up getting panic attacks, or what seemed to be panic attacks - went to the ER because I couldn’t control whatever was going on - they followed each vertigo spell. (Dizziness, brain fog, panic, racing heart, felt impending doom.) All tests came back normal, they said I was slightly dehydrated. 

October - still light sensitive, started noticing blurry vision in my right eye (goes away with away with drops), vertigo every few days only lasting a few minutes, still high anxiety but no panic - until the end of the month. Had back to back panic attacks from the vertigo, went back to the ER under the assumption it was just anxiety that I couldn’t control. They gave me a prescription for 10, .5mg Ativan. I’ve taken 1/2 dose four times since. 

This month - I’ve noticed that my right eye is almost constantly blurry unless I use drops, and that only helps for ten minutes, as well as a major uptick in tinnitus, and my right ear feels like it won’t pop majority of the time. I’ve also noticed that my right nostril is almost always clogged up - when I take my glasses off it unclogs within twenty minutes. 

Is this all a sinus infection/inflammation?? I’m on day four of trying Claritin and have noticed a bit of change but if this has been an infection the whole time I don’t think that would clear it?

started around the last week of october, went to er for the first time oct 29th

doctors told me i had a high white blood cell count the first er visit, but my records say my white blood cell count was actually normal? not sure why they told me that but whatever

took a covid test, negative

it gets worse at night, with any type of exertion, during/after eating

it has pretty much been consistent for the past two and a half weeks, but it gets better and then worse again

i feel like i have “attacks” of some sort where i go at least an hour not being able to catch my breath properly

i cant figure out what triggers it

might be anxiety/panic related, but it feels too physical for that to be all that it is. i think that i feel the symptoms and then panic and my panic makes it worse

inhaler (albuterol) makes it worse

no cough or wheeze

worry that it is caused by smoking (weed)?

I’m a bit confused about what “untested” really means here. Does it mean the blood never went through screening for HIV/HCV/syphilis, or that it didn’t go through additional screening which would make it clinically suitable?

Also, given that it’s untested or non-clinical, should I start PEP as a precaution? The exposure was percutaneous, and I’m within 72 hours. Specifically the 8th hour

So I just recently started recovering from alcoholism (3 weeks on Friday), and honestly not until right now did I realize that alcohol really had a big effect on my weight gain.

I was always skinny until I was 20. I moved away from my hometown and met this guy who I got engaged to. We moved in together and made some questionable food choices since we both worked and would pick up pizza on the way home. We didn't have access to the kitchen a lot because we rented a room at his friend's dad's house, and we didn't like to disturb him downstairs. 

When we moved back to my hometown we started going out a lot, and the kilos started piling on slowly but surely. I went to parties, drank a lot, etc. It got worse when we split up and I ate bad and started drinking a lot more. Over the last two years I've been pretty out of control tbh. So I decided to get sober.

Now afterwards I feel better, and I realized that the 3x times a week I drank, there were so many empty calories in what I was drinking (beer and wine), but I've started to get more hungry because of that. I been at a stable 77 kilograms for about a year now, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be back up to 80 by the end of December. It's winter in Norway, and the weather isn't very agreeable, especially here up north, so I don't go out for walks. Also we've got like 3 hours of daylight. 

I like chicken a lot, so I eat mainly that. And frozen vegetables. But I also eat a bunch of ordered in pizza, the pizza box pile I had stored in my bedroom was my big shame until my parents picked them up yesterday. 

Since I'm saving a lot of money on not buying alcohol anymore, I decided to join the gym with my brothers, but that's gonna be after new years. And I'm not making any resolutions, because I know I'm gonna beat myself up over it when I eventually fall off the weight loss wagon.

I have positive IgG antibodies for toxoplasma, EBV VCA, EBNA, Bartonella henselae, and tularemia (border line).

Everything began with one lymph node lump on my neck at the end of 2022. It was punctured and showed no concerning signs. In early 2023, after night of partying (and drinking alcohol), I had a major flare-up of lymph nodes that lasted for about two days. The swollen and painful lumps - very big I could feel them easily with fingers, were behind my ear, on my neck, under both armpits, and even in the groin/vaginal area.

Over the past two years, I’ve been tested for all sexually transmitted infections (HIV, gonorea and so on) and the other infections mentioned above. I had occasional lumps showing around my vagina, and occasional strong pain in armpits. The positive results were only mentioned IgGs - doctors thought it to be caused by toxoplasma. 

Finally a month ago infectologist ruled out that the cause may be any infection after they punctured a very small random lymph node under right armpit (they barely managed to get a sample). The biopsy showed no toxoplasma bodies, no bacteria, and no malignancy. Infectologist said it is definitely not infectional.

Yesterday I had an ultrasound of the breasts and abdomen, and everything appeared normal. I still have a constant, mild pain in my right armpit. 

However, I definitely figured out the trigger. Each time I drink alcohol — which is about once a month — the pain becomes significantly worse. For the next 48 hours, all the tissues from my elbows up to around my chest and breasts hurt intensely, and then the symptoms gradually fade until I’m left with the usual mild chronic pain. Pain is significally worse on the right side.

I’m moderately active and go to the gym, but I never experience these symptoms after intense exercise. I do feel the lymph node stabbing me under my right armpit when I stretch on a ladder. The point that stabs is not the one they punctured (probably couldnt see it). 

The upper chest tissue pain reaction and swelling seems to be triggered only by alcohol — I tested both beer and vodka separately, and both caused the same flare-up.

Other symptoms include back pain (I work in an office) and occasional knee pain when climbing stairs, which improves when I work out regularly. Besides that I sometimes have trouble with focus. My menstrual cycle is irregular, and my gynecologist said I have high testosterone, although I'm not taking any medication for it. I’m on the thicker side but not overweight. Sometimes, if I walk a lot or breathe heavily, I feel a stabbing pain in my upper right chest.

I don’t have weight loss, night sweats, or other systemic symptoms.

I’ve seen multiple doctors — including an immunologist who said I was fine a year ago — and I have an appointment with a hematologist in two weeks. 

About half of the specialists say they don’t know any condition that causes lymph node pain after alcohol, so I often feel like I’m an idiot. The only advice I get is haha “don’t drink,” which is frustrating because this has been happening for three years.

I’d appreciate advice on which specialists to see next and what conditions might cause these symptoms. If the ultrasound was normal, should I be worried? Should I get more detailed imaging?",,,,2025-11-27 06:00:22.848107+00,1,0,null,en,1,2025-11-27 05:40:11,20454,7,,,"[""diagnostics_monitoring"",""alcohol_related_flare_ups""]","[""lymph_node_pain"",""chest_pain"",""back_pain"",""knee_pain""]",[],"[""toxoplasmosis"",""EBV"",""high_testosterone""]",[],"[""lymph node pain after alcohol"",""positive IgG antibodies"",""alcohol trigger for pain"",""lymph node biopsy"",""pain reaction to alcohol""]",not_relevant,0.8,Detailed symptom inquiry without bariatric or PBH context,patient,0.7,"[""Diagnostics"",""Symptoms""]",negative,,"[""frustration""]","[""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_diagnostics_monitoring_036""]",

My weight has fluctuated over the last decade or so. I started back then around 288lbs, lost down to about 218lbs then started regaining again. Then had another try a few years later starting at 265lb, got down to 208lb and then started regaining (but slower), then started AGAIN in March at 248lb and now down to 208lb again. 

So this is only the second time I've gotten into the overweight category in my adult life (and the first time I stayed there for about 2 seconds lol). I'm posting to celebrate but also to remind myself I've undone all that regained weight AGAIN and its been tedious af. This is the time to not fuck it up and keep going. 

I'm a lot less restrictive this time and I've definitely had a few periods of maintenance eating rather than deficit, so its taken a while. I've noticed myself getting hungrier lately, so I've just done a couple of weeks at maintenance and now I've set my deficit calories higher for a while. I'm going to focus on things being sustainable from this point even if it means the rest of my weightloss is super slow.

Way less jumpy than my roommates renpho which tells him something different every time. Got a dexa done in like month 2 to compare. Hume said 16.4%, dexa said 17.8 so not exact but closer than i expected for a home scale. Weird thing was the regional breakdown matched pretty well.. both showed my legs holding more fat than torso which tracks, i ran for years before picking up weights

The left/right breakdown has been kinda useful actually? Been doing more unilateral work and can see the gap slowly closing which is cool to quantify vs just feeling it

Muscle mass numbers im less sure about tho. Feels way more variable day to day than bf%. Could be hydration or just BIA being BIA idk

Reasons I suspect this include migraines and cluster headaches, widespread pain but also neck and shoulder pain(including a major problem spot in that specific area), difficulties swallowing, chronic treatment resistant fight or flight/anxiety/depression, chest pains and shortness of breath(tests haven't shown major heart problems so far), stomach dumping syndrome but with chronic constipation, symptoms of POTs but haven't gotten testing for it yet, and some other smaller things. I feel my suspicion is very reasonable and have made an appointment to discuss it and probably get referred out but that will take time. Have already gotten many blood tests, some MRIs, CTs. 

  
My question is: How else can I get a head start on treating this? Online searches feel vague on what I can do for it. I've tried consistent chiropractic and there's definitely nerve compression going on in general but it doesn't seem to help. I attempt to meditate, etc, and I sing daily. My diet has been good. I get plenty of exercise via my job. I take propranolol and it helps a bit on the shortness of breath but not enough. Stuff for gut health like probiotics. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff I'm already doing, I've been desperately trying to feel at LEAST ok and centering my life around it for a while now. What else can I do? What other medications can be considered that aren't simply treating symptoms? How helpful can VNS potentially be at this stage of debilitating problems? The implanted device seems reasonable at this point but it's so expensive, what non-invasive devices may be worth trying? Most of the posts I see about VNS talk more about anxiety and HRV.
