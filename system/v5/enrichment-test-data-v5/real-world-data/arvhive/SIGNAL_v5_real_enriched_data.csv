Goal weight ✅,"A year ago, I was at my highest weight ever. I shattered my foot in early 2024, and shortly after accepted a temp job with 70-80 hour work weeks and a crazy drinking culture. Not being able to walk or exercise totally wrecked me.

I’m 5’3”, weighed at least 180 pounds (possibly 19x, the scale terrified me.) But a few weeks before surgery, I decided to start cycling. 

I made a choice that I wanted to get into the best shape of my life. And a year later, I’m here! 

What worked for me: 

I travel a LOT, I’ve moved four times this year, and there’s really no exact workout I could do consistently. 

Instead, I did what I could when I could — I love planks and body weight arm workouts, I cycle and lift weights when I have a gym, and I have loved learning to walk correctly again and starting to run.

I didn’t calorie count initially, but went to 1,600 and then 1,200 when I dialed in. When I travel, I don’t track, but I’ve gotten a lot better at intuitive eating and listening to my body. If I go on vacation and overeat, I go to 1600 and then 1,200 calories for a week or two after, If I find myself under-eating, I drink protein shakes, go out to eat, or ease up on my diet with a maintenance period. 

The hard parts:

Petite girls can’t lose very fast (healthy deficit is smaller), I take two appetite-increasing medications, and I couldn’t “just walk.” 

It worked for me to deficit harder during the day and eat more at night for a while, and then to switch to one alternative med two months ago. I focused on lifestyle, not fads, and really honed in on healthier eating habits without killing the fun times. 

The best parts:

I ate pizza, drank wine, enjoyed happy hours and traveled. I am happy I lost 43 pounds in 11 months instead of losing more and enjoying less.

I feel so much better every day.  Before I broke my foot, I was 10-15 pounds overweight and not active. Ultimately, I think this led me to a more balanced existence. Working out also helps a lot with my impulse control! 

Also, maintenance periods are so important! Take breaks and come back to weight loss! 

Now that I’ve hit my initial goal weight, I’m excited to get down to the mid range of my BMI and start building muscle! 

TLDR: 

Made it to my goal weight by focusing on workouts I like, maintaining when I felt tired, and doing what fit my ever-changing lifestyle.

I really need help getting my mom started on her weightloss journey. For context: we are from the south and the culture is very unhealthy in terms of dieting (not always, but the way we were raised it definitely wasn’t the best). My mom used to be in shape in her younger days (she’s 65 now), but I feel like she has gone through some pretty traumatic events that she won’t tell me about because her generation didn’t really acknowledge the complexities of mental health. Because of that I feel like she has eaten her emotions and again coupled with the culture of fried unhealthy foods in the south she is pretty obese.

Recently some health concerns have come up such as Abdominal bleeding and what not and although the labs come back normal and she has healthy biomarkers, I know that when the true decline comes it will be severe because of her weight. 

We have tried getting her on meal plans and even a weightloss plan and she lost some weight on, but she is having a hard time sticking to it and I think it’s because, as sad as it is to admit, she’s giving up on life. Most of her good friends and family have passed im all and although she still has a great support system she has kind of adopted a “when it’s my time it’s my time” mindset that is breaking my heart. 

I live out of state for work and so it’s hard to keep her accountable, but the biggest issue is I don’t know how to have the hard talk with her that I need to. It’s so hard trying to say I love you and I want you here because I have this weird mental block being her son. Growing up our culture is very, “you’re the child and I’m the adult so you can’t tell me anything” so even trying to articulate the severity of this situation and how much I Want it fixed is very hard.

I AM pursuing an appointment, I'm just trying to make an educated decision if I should be patient or pushing to be seen ASAP.

My timeline may be slightly off, they may have been there for awhile and just now big enough, or its rapid. But I noticed a small lump deep in my left back muscle near spine about 3 years ago when i was getting horrendous sharp pains when bending or leaning. Tried chiropractor/massage therapy at first but it never changed, went to PCP and they were dismissively calling it fat when the ultrasound didnt show anything (assuming the tech didnt miss it). Its now larger, painful, and the texture is different depending on how its touched. -- horizontal is gritty/fatty/fibrous, vertical is hard and not moving -- I also notice what seems to be a couple more tiny ones above and below it. My muscles have felt tight lately and I think I may be genetically prone to cysts. With that knowledge I have somewhat ignored growths in my hands and shoulder. I know I have a carpal boss on my left hand (half my life easily) and a boney bump at the base of 4th metacarpal on my right due to a fracture a few months ago. Presumably, due to chronic pain, broke my tailbone mid-june after slipping/bouncing butt on the last 3-4 steps in house. (3 doctor visits told me its pointless to xray) My question comes due to: in about 2 months I now feel around 25-30 soft/firm lumps of various size (.5cm-4cm diameter) spread head to toe. Near joints mostly, but for sure also on certain tendons and a couple muscles. I feel sore and cramping, on right side of body mostly.

I have a POTS diagnosis now, but it seems to vary a lot and the medications aren't really helping the way they should or side effects are just as bad if not worse than what they treat so im just raw dogging life.

first off: I know many people say to not trust any calorie estimations from anywhere. But I wanted to ask anyways.

So, I have a Garmin Venu 3S which I've been tracking with for about a month. Once a week, I do pure cardio training in the gym and go on the elliptical for 40min. I'm talking high intensity, with high settings and a decent to quick tempo, I'm doing interval training there and I can FEEL that I'm really really pushing myself and it's very exhausting. Talking about my watch says my bpm is on average through the workout at 158bpm and max of 183bpm. That is in the last zone (90-100%), even if only for 2.5min. Most of the time in the 80-90% zone. 

So, now to my watch: it has all my measurements (22f, 165cm, 90kg). I also logged it as elliptical, so it knows the training I do. It has recorded 430kcal for the 40min and I do wonder how accurate that is. Just from googling, I would say it sounds valid for the high intensity. 

Of course I take it with a grain of salt and I'm not planning to eat up those calories anyways, I'm just trying to get a grip on how accurate it is and if it's worth the high effort.

Maybe anyone has experience? I did read the newer smartwatches are pretty good at calculating calorie estimates, even though of course never completely accurate. But that I probably won't get closer to the real number any other way either. Any opinions?

Maybe on the same note: How accurate is also the amount of calories burned by step counts?",,,,2025-11-26 13:23:13.993332+00,1,0,null,en,2,2025-11-26 13:02:10,20158,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just got back from a four day all inclusive vacation, i was nervous going in as i knew i wouldn't be eating healthy and tracking like usual. i drank every night (way too many sugary drinks) and ate way too much food in the name of ""enjoying the moment""

weighed myself the day after i got back and was up 6lb :/ obviously was so discouraging but i got right back to my deficit and within 3 days i'm back to my prevacation weight, which means it was all water weight.

i felt so so sluggish and felt so low energy, the same feeling i used to get when i wasn't eating cleaning or paying attention to what i eat. my first workout back was awfullll. the kicker is all the food i ate wasn't even that good, i just ate it because it was there and i was tired of being so strict with my eating.

lessons learned though, none of the food tastes as good as the food i make at home, doesn't make me feel good and i'm not actually restricting by eating clean, it's my new normal",,,,2025-11-26 13:23:13.993332+00,4,0,null,en,0,2025-11-26 12:51:50,20362,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No medications. I do on and off physical therapy for hypertonic pelvic floor (may be relevant). 

So long story short, for the last week or so, I have had a warm, “raw” feeling after bowel movements. Key details are that it always improves after a shower/bidet, and it also never actually feels that way during the bowel movement, it’s only right after. I have no bleeding or any other discomfort. 

For context, this started last week right before I had an anal fissure recurrence in the 6 o clock position typical for them. I’ve had surgery for anal fissures 5 years ago, and this was my first recurrence. It healed very quickly. I went to my colorectal surgeon who inspected the area and didn’t say it was troubling and didn’t see any evidence of complications other than a small wound that would heal as the sphincter is less tight (and he was right). However, this warm and rawness feeling is not something I’ve had this long. Do these symptoms, without anything else like pain or bleeding, sound troubling? Could it be my hypertonic pelvic floor and overactive nerves? Maybe internal hemorrhoids?

other information. i do play video games, i do not experience the ache or pain when i play video games. i stopped playing video games for a month to see if the ache went away and it did not. i used to work as a mechanic which is where i experienced the ache most frequently while holding a wrench or other hand tool. most if not all of my siblings have similar wrist/ hand pain or discomfort. i have tried wearing braces for my hands but they did not fix the problem. i do drink a lot of milk and a few years back i stopped drinking milk for a week or two and i think i experienced a decrease in the aches but i cant be too sure if it was because of not drinking milk. i do have hypothyroidism for which i take .075 mg of levothyroxine for. i am 6 feet tall, i weigh close to 300 pounds. i am a smidge overweight but i am mostly muscular. i have taken ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the past and i dont recall a decrease in the aches or pain during or afterward.

I have a very good diet, hitting my macros and staying on (now) 2600kcal. I exercise 5 times a week. This consists of 2/3 days basketball and 2/3 days gym.

I’ve had a horrible few months, super high anxiety over all of this, I’m curious if it’s all because of my sinuses - and if that’s a possibility, would antibiotics even do anything at this point? 

August - noticed light sensitivity on and off, chalked it up to needing a new glasses prescription (I did need one)

September - not as often light sensitivity but still there, towards the end of the month I got a super bad day of vertigo. By the end of that day I ended up getting panic attacks, or what seemed to be panic attacks - went to the ER because I couldn’t control whatever was going on - they followed each vertigo spell. (Dizziness, brain fog, panic, racing heart, felt impending doom.) All tests came back normal, they said I was slightly dehydrated. 

October - still light sensitive, started noticing blurry vision in my right eye (goes away with away with drops), vertigo every few days only lasting a few minutes, still high anxiety but no panic - until the end of the month. Had back to back panic attacks from the vertigo, went back to the ER under the assumption it was just anxiety that I couldn’t control. They gave me a prescription for 10, .5mg Ativan. I’ve taken 1/2 dose four times since. 

This month - I’ve noticed that my right eye is almost constantly blurry unless I use drops, and that only helps for ten minutes, as well as a major uptick in tinnitus, and my right ear feels like it won’t pop majority of the time. I’ve also noticed that my right nostril is almost always clogged up - when I take my glasses off it unclogs within twenty minutes. 

Is this all a sinus infection/inflammation?? I’m on day four of trying Claritin and have noticed a bit of change but if this has been an infection the whole time I don’t think that would clear it?

One of my closest friends recently started seeing a woman who reports having POTS, MCAS, and Borderline Personality Disorder. According to him, she spends most of her time on Reddit and TikTok, is active in all the related subreddits, and presents in a very histrionic way. She has rainbow-dyed hair, frequently posts on Facebook about situations in which she portrays herself as a victim, and overall seems to thrive on that narrative. I’m trying not to judge her prematurely, but the more time I spend around her, the more alarmed I feel.

When we finally met, she immediately wanted to discuss medical issues because she knew I’m a physician. She told me her tilt-table test was “strange” because her heart rate was “always high,” including before and after the test. She also said that the same physician who diagnosed her MCAS told her she “likely” had POTS during the initial visit, which is why she got the tilt-table test in the first place. Her NP PCP reportedly suggested MCAS after checking a tryptase level during a period of severe seasonal allergies, which came back elevated. I asked if she’d ever had her tryptase checked outside of an allergic flare or presumed MCAS episode, and she said no. She also told me that because I’m “just Family Med,” I “wouldn’t understand the intricacies” of her conditions. Meanwhile, during the time we spent together, she drank three large cups of coffee despite having complained earlier that her POTS was acting up.

My friend is getting worried because she’s now talking about applying for disability so she can stop working, and he isn’t prepared to support her financially. He also says she frequently “triggers” her own MCAS by intentionally eating leftovers, consuming dairy, or putting herself into highly stressful situations. Her anxiety has escalated to the point where she insists he sleep on FaceTime with her every night to help her calm down.

I genuinely don’t think this relationship is healthy for him. He isn’t medical, and I’m struggling with how to explain, from both a medical and a friend perspective, that all of this raises major red flags and doesn’t pass the smell test. Should I tell him directly so he can avoid getting hurt? Has anyone dealt with something similar?

TL;DR: My friend is dating a woman with multiple self-reported diagnoses, dramatic behavior, questionable medical claims, and escalating dependence on him. She’s talking about going on disability and creating situations that worsen her symptoms. I’m worried she’s unhealthy for him and don’t know how to tell him without overstepping.

I've suffered from GAD, panic disorder, health anxiety and PTSD from the time I was a teenager. I'm 37M now. I come from a family who shuns medicine and doctors so that's been instilled in my brain forever. That being said things got pretty rough in the late 2010s and I finally went on Zoloft. Got up to 100mg. It must have worked because I was able to hold and excel at my office job, have a relationship, etc. Due to sexual side effects I worked with my doctor to come off Zoloft. Things went well. Then COVID hit, and my relationship also ended shortly after. Still, things were ok.

Jump to 2023, I'm still working remote from COVID (caught COVID as well late 2022), and have an otherwise normal life. One day I realized how nice my life was, and then suddenly became afraid of losing it. Within a couple of weeks I started having these ""drop attack"" dizzy spells that lasted 1-2 seconds (I've had these before but they became much more frequent), panic attacks, etc. I stopped going on my morning runs and generally leaving the house.

2024, we have to start going back into the office once a week. This is where I realize I've developed some agoraphobia. I had to white knuckle my way through the days and meetings. During one meeting I sat up from being reclined a bit in my seat to answer a question, and immediately got short of breath and moment of chest pain while answering. It was so bad I stopped and told them I felt weird. Everyone was very understanding, and I went home. The moment I got in my car I felt relief but was still shook up. Did not see a doctor. I then began to have panic attacks any time I had to go into the office, and even started having them occasionally with camera-on virtual meetings.

End of 2024, I lose my job of 10 years. They wanted me back in the office full time, I let them know of my agoraphobia and started working with a new psychiatrist to get treatment and be able to return to the office. On the surface my job was very understanding. A week into my treatment (started on Prozac) and 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was fired. Suddenly without insurance I could no longer afford $400+ visits to my new psych, the first week of Prozac was hell, so I had to stop. I start dreaming nearly nightly about either losing the job I had, or having to work old fast food jobs. These dreams continue even today.

2025 - Hell. With no job and an extreme amount of stress, I became bedbound. Only getting up to use the bathroom or go downstairs to grab food. I started noticing my heart rate would skyrocket anytime I stood up or moved around (from the 70-80s to 120-160+). A couple times I would be walking fine, feel flutters in my stomach, then suddenly feel faint and hit a HR of 170+. Of course stupidly googling it I see POTS everywhere. I'm now convinced I have POTS. I began getting up less and less, showering less, and literally laying in bed 24/7 unless I absolutely had to get up. My roommate does all the chores and brings me food/water.

Now - I can't even eat or drink. About 2 weeks ago I had a small fast food meal. One I have somewhat often without issue. Within an hour anytime I shifted even slightly my HR went to 150-170, I felt extremely lethargic, and anxious. I had to lay on my left side completely still to keep my HR around 80. My stomach was so bloated and I couldn't stop burping. I was on the phone with family and told them I think I needed a hospital, but because I was around a 160 HR just shifting in bed I had no idea how I'd get up and be taken in a car. They calmed me down and eventually (hours) it all passed, I fell asleep. Since then I have been TERRIFIED to eat. I've been getting maybe 200-400 calories a day from things like nuts, plain chips, eggs, etc. I was drinking water fine. A couple days ago, the same kind of situation happened on just water in my stomach. Severe bloating, very high tachycardia when moving, and stomach burning. I sat up to try and relieve the pressure and as soon as I did my HR went to 170, my hands went numb/tingly, and I started hyperventilating. I called a family member again and they calmed me down, got me breathing right, and it went away within a few minutes.

Throughout all of this I still have random dizzy attacks, pressure/pain on the back side of my neck, I don't sweat (as in I just get VERY WARM and physically do not sweat, I get prickly), and am very heat sensitive. I've also had a couple instances where I would lay flat on my back for about 30 minutes, then sit up and would get very lightheaded, dizzy, and my HR would jump way up to 150s. I'd have to hold onto something to stabilize myself until it passed.

From the literal second I wake up every day I worry about how I'm feeling. I'm getting less than 20oz of liquid a day (trying to sip Pedialyte now but it's causing bloating again) and barely eating. I feel so weak, defeated, anxious, and have no idea what to do. I was ""surviving"" before this because eating/drinking were generally not giving me any discomfort. Occasionally I would get very tired after a meal, or have lots of stomach noises prior to the day of the big episode. Now the moment I even open a drink my HR spikes. I feel like the only way out is a hospital but I'm unemployed with no insurance. I literally sit in bed all day and think about how to get out of this. I dread even rolling over because when I do my HR goes from 80s to 130s (then quickly back down). I will also note that I start hyperventilating very easily. It's an immediate subconscious trigger any time I feel even slightly off, I start very rapid short chest breathing.

I have access to 2 things that I want to try taking but am terrified to.

100mg Zoloft - I still have about 90 days of this from when I titrated off in 2020.

10mg Propranolol - Was given 90 days of this with the Prozac and never took it.

I understand medical advice can't really be given. Observations and input are most welcome.

I just have such a hard time believing this is all anxiety. My brain is 100% convinced I have POTS from COVID, stomach cancer, diabetes, or heart failure. I have about a years worth of money left before I'm completely out and want to fix myself SO BAD so I can get back to a normal life of working, going outside, seeing my family, etc. My severe agoraphobia, and being completely bedridden make it feel impossible for me to visit an in-person health care professional. I feel trapped and don't even know where to start on a path to answers and recovery.

It might be a bit long, I'll try to summarize as much as possible 

I hadn't felt well for years and had all the symptoms of anemia/low B12 and iron, and over the years it got worse to the point where I started having horrible shortness of breath, extreme dizziness, drowning, not being able to sleep because I was out of breath and ended up going to the emergency room in the early hours of the morning, horrible Panic attacks and finally hallucinations similar to those of magic mushrooms when I had several sessions of very high doses to get rid of the SSRIs that I used for over 10 years (I'm 28 currently), which really worked and I became a different person.

But I started to notice that some possible ""symptoms"" of the SSRI or depression and anxiety didn't go away, they just became weaker, but as I said above they started to get worse as time went on.

In fact, whenever I could, I took good multivitamins and vitamin D, at least enough when I had a lack of time, money, etc.

But these last 6-8 months I started to have more time and money to supplement with good brands and specific vitamins B12 methyl, folate, VitD and finally I started with iron.

My vitamin D went up a lot from 18&gt;31&gt;50+

B12 reached 800 in the second exam but in the third exam a few months later, it dropped to 450

The big problem here, the doctor only ordered iron tests in the last one, now in November, but I had already been supplementing iron for about 4 months, about 2 months with a low dose and the last 2 months with a medium/high dose.

The doctor said that my vitamin tests are great and just keep taking the low dose iron supplement and come back after 3 months

But my iron and saturation % is far below the minimum even after these 4 months.

And B12 has dropped a lot and I don't want to go back to taking B12, at least the sublingual methyl form, because it gives me insomnia and a lot of agitation.

Do I continue with the high dose of iron for a while longer or do I order an infusion right away? Because I notice that if I stop taking the supplement for about 5-10 days the symptoms get worse, it's as if the supplement was ""holding it"" so I don't return with those horrible symptoms.

What about B12? Will the hydroxocobalamin injection cause me agitation like methyl?

In fact, my triglycerides increased even more, even though I started eating better and exercising on the bike when I started to have more energy because of the iron, and I also lost about 15-20kgs.

Thank you in advance

I’m writing this because I feel completely broken. I’m a male in my 20s, and for the past 3 years, I’ve been living in a daily loop of hell.
The Origin
It started at 18 with chronic sinusitis. Once treated, strange symptoms lingered (urge to yawn, burping).
3 years ago, during a trip to Finland, symptoms exploded. Since that day, the cycle has never left me.
The Endless Cycle (24/7)
1. Breathing (""Air Hunger"" / Dyspnea)
I have a constant, compulsive urge to take deep, gasping breaths (through nose or mouth).
The Trap: If I give in and take that deep breath, I feel immediate relief/satisfaction, but it triggers the urge again instantly. One satisfying breath demands thousands more.
Resistance: If I try to resist, I get extremely anxious, and my body reacts with ""hics"" (short, involuntary respiratory spasms).
Waking Up: It’s automatic. My body takes a huge, uncontrollable gasp of air the moment I open my eyes.
Exertion: Panic mode. Walking up a hill makes me feel asphyxiated instantly.
2. Belching (Supragastric?)
I burp hundreds of times a day. It’s not digestive (no smell, no taste, not linked to meals). It feels like air trapped in my throat.
Mouth Open: Loud burp.
Mouth Closed: It makes a weird internal ""gurgling/croaking"" noise (suppressed burp).
Weird Detail: I noticed that if I intentionally breathe through my mouth, the burping stops. As soon as I switch back to nasal breathing, it returns.
3. Saliva (The Trigger?)
I have hypersalivation. I am forced to swallow every 15-30 seconds. I feel like this constant swallowing forces me to gulp down air.
4. Physical Tension
Constant tension on the left side of my face, temple, and jaw.
Clicking sound in my left ear when I swallow.
THE KEY CLUES
SLEEP (Crucial Detail): This is the only break I get. I sleep perfectly fine. It never wakes me up. My body breathes perfectly on autopilot when I'm unconscious. The nightmare restarts the second I wake up.
The Mountain: I had one week of total remission a year ago during a trip to the mountains. Zero symptoms. It came back immediately after I returned home.
Tests: Endoscopy and pH monitoring are normal.
I don't spend my days obsessing over my breathing for fun; I am being attacked by my own reflexes. I just want to be able to sigh ONCE or yawn ONCE like a normal person, without my body triggering a compulsive need to take thousands more right after.
Has anyone experienced this specific mix?
Thank you.",,,,2025-11-26 21:00:27.751004+00,7,0,null,en,2,2025-11-26 20:15:57,20416,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over time, my hair gradually turned medium brown with golden highlights. Many of my relatives had lighter hair in childhood, which tells me that my genetics allow for lighter shades within a certain natural range. I’m healthy, under parental supervision, and curious about whether it’s possible to naturally shift my hair back toward lighter tones without dyes or chemical bleaching. I want to be clear that I’m not trying to change my DNA—my goal is to open the biological pathways that allow my hair to express the lighter shades it’s already capable of producing. Essentially, I want my hair to “remember” the blonde range it had in childhood, within the limits my genetics allow.

To try to achieve this, the plan is to optimize the internal environment of my hair follicles. Hair color depends on melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment. The goal is to reduce the production of darker pigment (eumelanin), favor lighter pigment (pheomelanin), protect the melanocytes so they function consistently, and reduce oxidative stress that could darken existing pigment. This is approached using supplements, lifestyle habits, and careful hair care.

Here’s the supplement stack I’m using and the purpose of each:
	•	Resveratrol – powerful antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in hair follicles and supports mitochondrial function.
	•	Curcumin – anti-inflammatory compound that can modulate pigment-related enzymes, helping slightly reduce eumelanin production.
	•	L-theanine – helps lower cortisol and systemic stress, which can protect melanocytes from stress-induced dysfunction.
	•	Ginkgo biloba – improves microcirculation, supporting nutrient delivery to hair follicles.
	•	B-complex vitamins – support cellular metabolism and division in hair follicles, maintaining healthy melanocyte activity.
	•	Zinc – cofactor for melanogenesis enzymes, helping balance pigment production.
	•	Vitamin A – involved in cell differentiation in follicles and supports normal melanocyte function.
	•	Vitamin D – regulates gene expression in follicles and supports proper melanocyte activity.
	•	PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone) – mitochondrial support, ensuring melanocytes have energy to function efficiently.
	•	Alpha-lipoic acid – antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in the follicle.
	•	EGCG (green tea extract) – may influence melanogenesis and protect pigment cells from damage.
	•	Quercetin – antioxidant that helps reduce oxidative stress in follicle cells.
	•	Astaxanthin – protects pigment-producing cells and reduces cellular damage.
	•	Lutein &amp; Zeaxanthin – antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage.
	•	Glutathione – master antioxidant that can shift pigment production slightly toward lighter tones (pheomelanin).
	•	NAC (N-Acetylcysteine) – precursor to glutathione, supporting its production in cells.
	•	Vitamin C &amp; E – classic antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress, helping prevent darkening of existing pigment.

Alongside supplementation, mild sun exposure and gentle hair care are included to help highlight natural lightening over time. The approach is entirely natural, with no chemical dyes, no bleaching, and no genetic modification. The goal is to work within my natural potential and gradually shift my hair toward lighter tones that my genetics and family history suggest.

I’m a 26-year-old male with a long history of heavy cigar smoking and daily drinking (about a decade). I quit both 3 months ago, but my symptoms haven’t improved at all, and I feel like I’m getting nowhere with doctors. I’m posting here because I don’t know what else to do.

Here’s what’s been going on:

Chronic back pain every single day for months.

Severe GERD/acid reflux earlier this year that eventually subsided, but right around that time everything else started.

Extreme fatigue – I’ve been sleeping 16 hours a day for months, which is totally unlike me.

35 pounds of weight loss unintentionally.

Yellow stool and what looks like undigested food in my stool every day.

“Rib poke” pain on my side almost daily.

Dry mouth constantly.

New moles appearing on my body.

Persistent anxiety that something deeper is wrong,I never really had health anxiety until now  but I can’t get any clear answers.


Tests I’ve already had:

Ultrasound RUQ

CT scan of the abdomen (without contrast)

Blood work (normal WBC now, but was low before)


Despite all this, my doctors won’t order an MRI or further imaging. Every appointment feels like a dead end.

I know Reddit can’t diagnose me. I’m just trying to understand what steps I can take next, what kinds of doctors or specialists I should be asking for, and why symptoms like these might not show up on the tests I’ve had.

Given my smoking/drinking history, I can’t shake the fear that I’m dealing with something serious, maybe cancer, even though I know that can’t be confirmed online. I’m just trying to figure out how to advocate for myself and get someone to investigate this properly.

Something was clearly wrong, but my physician just kept telling me to ""take some paracetamol and eat less.""  
I should mention: I'm 181 cm tall, have a history of ulcerative colitis, adhd and bipolar disorder. 

I'd been prescribed citalopram right before the weight gain started, so I figured that might be the culprit and stopped taking it. Nothing changed. Instead, new symptoms started appearing: exercise-induced migraines, constant fatigue, worsening depression (which I expected after quitting SSRIs), and premature ejaculation.

By 2020 I was desperate, so I dropped my intake to 900 calories a day while maintaining my exercise routine. Lost 20 kg over a year, felt pretty good about it, went back to the gym. Despite eating 900-1100 calories daily and working out hard four days a week, I gained 10 kg back within months. The migraines during exercise never stopped. I quit the gym again and somehow maintained 107-116 kg while eating 1100-1400 calories weekdays and around 2000 on weekends, doing intermittent fasting and moderate exercise. This went on from early 2021 to early 2025.

I had my thyroid checked, diabetes testing, cortisol - all came back normal.

In January this year I'd had enough. My physician(s) refused to check my prolactin and testosterone, so I changed healthcare centers (third time). The new doctor actually told me: ""Where I'm from we do fasting as you're probably aware, it's the healthiest thing you can do. Perhaps try not eating for the first 3 days of the week, then going max 800 for the other days? Also go do kickboxing, it's great for burning fat. Your body doesn't just burn calories, you need to exercise hard. Honestly, if I were you, I'd probably want to kill myself too."" I reported him and changed centers again.

The third (actually, more like 9th, I've lost count) physician finally, reluctantly, agreed to test my prolactin but made it clear: ""I'll grant you a prolactin test, but I shouldn't. We've been instructed to limit these types of tests as they're very costly.""

The result came back at 688 mIE/L. Pretty damn elevated (I think?), though my physician has made sure to point out ""not dangerously high"" about a hundred times. I got put on an 18-24 month waiting list for an MRI. I said fuck it and went private - got the MRI within a week.

Here's where it gets worse. My physician received the MRI results but never reached out. After waiting a month, I called and got booked for a phone consultation three weeks later. Was told they found ""nothing seriously abnormal"" and to come back for another prolactin test in a month. I requested a copy of the MRI results but never received one.

Second test came back at 693 mIE/L - essentially unchanged. My physician sent a referral to the endocrinology department, but it was denied. Why? Because he stated in the referral that I was on citalopram, which he claimed was likely the cause. Except I hadn't been on citalopram for 6-7 years at that point, and he knew this.

I wrote my own referral. This time I got a phone call: ""It's most likely weight-related, so go ahead and lose some weight and we'll do more tests."" At this point I was eating at most 1200 calories a day (usually less, except weekends which reached 2200 at most), doing intermittent fasting, and running 8 km daily.

I called my healthcare center one final time and was prescribed Wegovy without so much as a phone consultation. Started immediately. After a month I began losing weight despite eating the same calories. Went from 111 kg to 93 kg in four months, been floating around 93-95 kg for the last couple months on 2.4 mg (being reduced to 1.7 mg in two weeks).

Contacted my healthcare center last week for my third prolactin test since they, again, failed to reach out. The result? 688 mIE/L. Identical to the first test. My physician told me: ""There's nothing to do. You'll live. Congrats on the weight loss. Don't even bother with a referral, they'll deny you again. Now, we'll gradually lower your Wegovy dosage to 0.5 mg and if you start gaining significantly you'll have to reach out to me.""

So my prolactin hasn't budged despite losing 18 kg. The exercise-induced migraines are still there. The fatigue, the sexual dysfunction, all of it. And apparently there's nothing to do.

I've consulted ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude (don't laugh at me!) with my complete medical journals and diet logs, and they all suggest this warrants further investigation. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm crazy, if every physician I've encountered is incompetent, or if the systematic cost-cutting in Swedish healthcare over the past 30 years has finally reached this level. I worked as a nurse and saw the deterioration firsthand, but experiencing it as a patient is something else entirely.

Would this be handled differently in say, Denmark, USA, or elsewhere? Is persistently elevated prolactin with unchanged levels despite significant weight loss not concerning? Is it normal to order an MRI, not communicate results properly, and refuse to provide a copy when requested?

I honestly don't know anymore. It feels really hopeless.",,,,2025-11-26 21:00:27.751004+00,0,0,null,en,1,2025-11-26 19:57:01,20421,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like my left kneecap is now sitting higher that supposed to, cause of constant irritation. 

I stretch multiple times a day and do lots of physio. I dont feel pain squatting, but I feel it the next couple days, I have then difficulty walking and have weird constant pain.

1 year ago my knees were queaking a little, but now, its getting worse and worse. They both pop behind kneecap every time (or almost) that I get up from sitting or just that i unbend knee, or do glute bridges, etc. These constant pops and grinding of the patella drives me crazy and hurts. I work sitting in an office all day, which does not help, but I try to move a lot and take little walks and stretch. 

I saw 3 physios, 1 orthopedic doctor 2 times, going on the 3rd. I cant do this anymore I got to improve. 

I was planning on doing a roadtrip all winter and ski (slowly not too crazy) and it kills me not getting better even after all the efforts I put into physio and gym.

Is this degree of fatigue cause for alarm? Why does my blood pressure feel unusually low? At what point do I pivot from ""rest and hydrate more"" toward ""this is a legitimate cause for concern""?

It was leg day and I was trying to lift the barbell to the squat rack since it was set up for deadlifts, but I lifted it the wrong way (basically a 45 lb reverse curl, which I’m no where near). However, having been about 8 days since, my wrist feels a lot better. The regular pain is gone, and it really only appears when I put excessive pressure on it or twisting it too much, which is normal for a recovering wrist. I can also do around a 25-30 degree pronation with my arm bent at 90 degrees without any pain, but doing wrist stretches can push it to 45-50 degrees. I can also lift my 25 lb dumbbell at home with my injured wrist without any pain (tho I only did it once since I know even simply lifting heavy objects and putting them down too soon can cause reinjury or prolong the recovery if I do it too much). From this current state, it seems like I only have a Grade 1 sprain, so it shouldn’t take too much longer to heal. Although I was wondering, would it be possible to return to the gym and at least do a lighter version of my upper body workouts next week? Monday is the first upper body workout of the week, so if I’m able to start a light version up again then, that would be great as I’m trying to get stronger and improve my physique.

Here is my normal Monday weight routine: 

Bench Press: 75 lb
Lateral Raise: 5 lb
Cable Row: 55 lb
Tricep Pushdown: 20 lb
Bicep Curl: 10 lb

My brain and body literally work faster and better and I’m able to accomplish so much more in a day. 

Unfortunately I’m gaining weight instead of losing. It really sucks that losing weight makes me feel so crappy and I’m gonna have to jump back on the wagon again.

31427,reddit.com,t3_1p7ta7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1p7ta7f/alcohol_and_weight_loss/,Alcohol and weight loss,"Rant incoming. I'm 28F, 4'11 and 77 kg.

So I just recently started recovering from alcoholism (3 weeks on Friday), and honestly not until right now did I realize that alcohol really had a big effect on my weight gain.

I was always skinny until I was 20. I moved away from my hometown and met this guy who I got engaged to. We moved in together and made some questionable food choices since we both worked and would pick up pizza on the way home. We didn't have access to the kitchen a lot because we rented a room at his friend's dad's house, and we didn't like to disturb him downstairs. 

When we moved back to my hometown we started going out a lot, and the kilos started piling on slowly but surely. I went to parties, drank a lot, etc. It got worse when we split up and I ate bad and started drinking a lot more. Over the last two years I've been pretty out of control tbh. So I decided to get sober.

Now afterwards I feel better, and I realized that the 3x times a week I drank, there were so many empty calories in what I was drinking (beer and wine), but I've started to get more hungry because of that. I been at a stable 77 kilograms for about a year now, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be back up to 80 by the end of December. It's winter in Norway, and the weather isn't very agreeable, especially here up north, so I don't go out for walks. Also we've got like 3 hours of daylight. 

I like chicken a lot, so I eat mainly that. And frozen vegetables. But I also eat a bunch of ordered in pizza, the pizza box pile I had stored in my bedroom was my big shame until my parents picked them up yesterday. 

Since I'm saving a lot of money on not buying alcohol anymore, I decided to join the gym with my brothers, but that's gonna be after new years. And I'm not making any resolutions, because I know I'm gonna beat myself up over it when I eventually fall off the weight loss wagon. 

Anyway... for any people in here in recovery... did you notice some weight falling off when you quit your addiction?

I have positive IgG antibodies for toxoplasma, EBV VCA, EBNA, Bartonella henselae, and tularemia (border line).

Everything began with one lymph node lump on my neck at the end of 2022. It was punctured and showed no concerning signs. In early 2023, after night of partying (and drinking alcohol), I had a major flare-up of lymph nodes that lasted for about two days. The swollen and painful lumps - very big I could feel them easily with fingers, were behind my ear, on my neck, under both armpits, and even in the groin/vaginal area.

Over the past two years, I’ve been tested for all sexually transmitted infections (HIV, gonorea and so on) and the other infections mentioned above. I had occasional lumps showing around my vagina, and occasional strong pain in armpits. The positive results were only mentioned IgGs - doctors thought it to be caused by toxoplasma. 

Finally a month ago infectologist ruled out that the cause may be any infection after they punctured a very small random lymph node under right armpit (they barely managed to get a sample). The biopsy showed no toxoplasma bodies, no bacteria, and no malignancy. Infectologist said it is definitely not infectional.

Yesterday I had an ultrasound of the breasts and abdomen, and everything appeared normal. I still have a constant, mild pain in my right armpit. 

However, I definitely figured out the trigger. Each time I drink alcohol — which is about once a month — the pain becomes significantly worse. For the next 48 hours, all the tissues from my elbows up to around my chest and breasts hurt intensely, and then the symptoms gradually fade until I’m left with the usual mild chronic pain. Pain is significally worse on the right side.

I’m moderately active and go to the gym, but I never experience these symptoms after intense exercise. I do feel the lymph node stabbing me under my right armpit when I stretch on a ladder. The point that stabs is not the one they punctured (probably couldnt see it). 

The upper chest tissue pain reaction and swelling seems to be triggered only by alcohol — I tested both beer and vodka separately, and both caused the same flare-up.

Other symptoms include back pain (I work in an office) and occasional knee pain when climbing stairs, which improves when I work out regularly. Besides that I sometimes have trouble with focus. My menstrual cycle is irregular, and my gynecologist said I have high testosterone, although I'm not taking any medication for it. I’m on the thicker side but not overweight. Sometimes, if I walk a lot or breathe heavily, I feel a stabbing pain in my upper right chest.

I don’t have weight loss, night sweats, or other systemic symptoms.

I’ve seen multiple doctors — including an immunologist who said I was fine a year ago — and I have an appointment with a hematologist in two weeks. 

About half of the specialists say they don’t know any condition that causes lymph node pain after alcohol, so I often feel like I’m an idiot. The only advice I get is haha “don’t drink,” which is frustrating because this has been happening for three years.

I’d appreciate advice on which specialists to see next and what conditions might cause these symptoms. If the ultrasound was normal, should I be worried?

I sat down and after 10–15 minutes of sitting, when I started walking, it began to sting while I was walking. I went to wipe again and noticed blood on the toilet paper. Not in the stool, but on the paper. I’ve attached pictures of the anus where I tried to take a photo, and if you look closely you can see a small red scratch or dot or something similar. There is no history of bowel diseases in my family. The day before I didn’t eat anything cooked, just pizza and a few bakery products, and I drank blueberry tea. Since I’m a hypochondriac and I know that photos can’t replace a medical examination, please understand that right now I’m unable to go to the doctor because I’m a student outside my home country and medical care is very expensive, and I barely have money for food and I have no parents.

Currently waiting for a referral to a cardiologist after speaking with my GP about an incident involving chest pain (early morning soon after waking up felt sudden chest pain, jolt of pain that didn't last long, didn't get worse, didn't radiate out).

GP didn't seem too worried about heart during an appointment the day after the event (thinks it may be gallbladder related and ordered bloodwork and ultrasounds for that) but had limited diagnostics (blood pressure normal, pulse ox looked fine) put in a cardiologist referral just to be on the safe side but with the holiday it may be a few days before I can get in short of an emergency.

Not currently a cardiac patient so I'm new to this. I got a Kardia 6L (yes, I know it is not a real medical device or as good as a real 12 lead EKG, though it is FDA approved) in the meantime and have been over testing when not showing symptoms due to anxiety.

Most tests come back fine, normal sinus rhythm, one (attached) came back SINUS RHYTHM WITH WIDE QRS. How worrying is this for someone already in the process of being referred to a cardiologist but without a set appointment as of yet?

I need advice regarding a rash that developed after a fever. My fever began about four days ago and has since resolved completely.

My key symptoms were:

High Fever and Severe Aches: Sudden onset of high fever and severe, widespread muscle pain (body, arms, hands) that lasted about 2 days.

Fever Resolution: The fever broke and has been stable since Day 3.

The Rash: A rash appeared as the fever was breaking. It started as red, prickly patches, especially on my chest and back. Now, on Day 4, the patches on my arms and legs are flat, red spots, non-itchy, and not painful. However, the rash has now appeared on my face.

Anyways again most recent appointment we were going over my at home sleep study, I don't snore I just stop breathing, she says it's because of my Adderall - me and my partner quickly shut that down as I've been on and off it for years and even stopped it for the study. Then tries to go on a tangent that I'm bipolar? Which I'm not I have BPD but not bipolar but I need to see a psychiatrist (I am) and I won't get disability without that diagnosis because sleep problems and fibromyalgia won't get me approved. I- ugh, I have never spoken to her about my disability claim, only for the fact of seeing her for 2 years, I can not sleep or sleep for days on end. There is no in-between and it's getting worse used to stay awake a whole day or sleep an entire day, now it's 4 days awake , 4 days asleep, which is making me lose my mind, again Ive had this problem since I was a child, my family even joked I had ""sleeping beauty disease"" , I never feel rested and my doctor is a joke. Oh and she wants me to get off my medications as I take to many but wants my psychiatrist to prescribe me bipolar meds. The insurance comment btw was because she called my insurance twice and couldn't get ahold of anyone..  which is funny as she has had these results for months and never set up a follow up or knew they were ready(which was months) until I contacted patient advocacy because she wasnt replying back to me, how funny. Anyways I wanted to rant about thick quack doctor and ask again; 

I 30F have had sleep problems since I was a child, I'm always tired and it's been getting worse. I used to sleep days on end and still feel exhausted after. Now it's I can't sleep for days or sleep for days, I'm losing my mind. Sleep study results says I have mild sleep apnea and just stop breathing. Sleep medicine works(like a week or 2) until it doesn't where I'll take it and just stay awake. I feel more exhausted during day light hours but can not take a nap.

From ages 19 - 26 I had kinda severe-ish anorexia. I never dropped below 103 lbs, so I wasn't, like, skeletal (I'm 5'6"") but for several years I ate fewer than 500 calories per day on average so I guess that did a number on my body. I have been a solid 155 lbs ish for the last 4 years since entering ED treatment; this seems to be the weight my body prefers. I have been in recovery since age 27 and have eaten totally normally since then and work out regularly.

But from ages 22 forward I've had really severe constipation on and off. Even when my Crohn's flares, it presents as constipation. It took me a while to get diagnosed bc of that; most doctors do not associated constipation with Crohn's. But now my GI doctor thinks my constipation is actually independent of my Crohn's. I recently got an anorectal manometry test. I have a few questions:

1. Can you help me interpret the main finding? I don't understand it and am having trouble finding results online. It says the following: **""Impression: Mildly hypertensive internal anal sphincter. No evidence of dyssynergia or Hirschsprung's disease. Increased thresholds may represent neuromodulatory medication (if any) or sequela of disordered eating; decreased tolerance to maximum rectal filling may represent IBS.""** (I am not on any neuromodulatory medication and have not been for the last 5 years. my only medication is skyrizi and this issue predates that)
2. Why did it take 3 years for my doctor to order this test for me? I have been complaining of constipation for the last 3 years. I've been prescribed linzess, told to take fibercon, and take daily miralax. I got two second opinions at ""the best crohn's center in the country."" No one suggested an anorectal manometry to me. I found it through some online ""second opinion"" service and I'm just kinda disappointed in my doctors that they never suggested it, and that I had to be the one to suggest it to them. Is this test not a standard-of-care thing? I really love my doctor so I don't want to ask her this bc it is a relatively combative question and I don't want her to think I'm upset with her. But I want to understand why she (or the other two docs i saw) didn't suggest it sooner and why I had to be the one to bring it up.

I’m 18 and had a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted in June 2024 due to sinus node dysfunction (HR dropped to 29 bpm, pauses up to 2800 ms). Before that I had one vasovagal syncope.

Weight changes:

• My normal weight was 66 kg

• Because of poor diet and illness I dropped to 55 kg before the surgery

• After recovery I gained weight back to 68 kg, but my symptoms stayed the same

Tests after surgery were mostly normal:

• Pacemaker working normally

• Echo mostly normal except mild aortic root dilation and mild valve prolapse

• Good exercise tolerance (HR up to 173 on treadmill)

• Screening for autoimmune, thyroid, adrenal issues was negative

• Had vitamin D toxicity earlier but resolved

Also blood test was pretty normal

My current symptoms (1,5 years after surgery):

• Hands and feet get very cold if I sit for 1–2 hours

• Fingers may get slightly numb when sitting

• Strong cold intolerance when resting

• Symptoms improve when I stand or move

• Poor sleep quality

• No more syncope, but clear signs of autonomic dysfunction

before surgery was able to drink a lot of coffe, about 2 cups a day, right now I am not able to due to bad tolerance to a caffeine: even small cup of tea makes uncomfortable.

Neurologist said it’s not his specialty. Cardiologists say the pacemaker works fine.

Also was working with adding the weight, counting macronutriens, prioritizing only healthy foods, cardio 2-3 days a week zone 2

My question:

I've had bleeding on and off since this summer (I dont have health insurance so thats why I have yet to get it checked out) but it has started to get worse within the last month. The bleeding is becoming heavier and more frequent. It is typically mixed in with the stool, tints the toilet bowl pink or reddish, and smears on the toilet paper. Sometimes there are tiny clots and sometimes it drips a bit into my underwear too.

Tonight I went to go poop and I didnt pass any stool but only passed some light gas. I bled into the toilet bowl still, though, and I'll include a photo of that. I asked my husband to take a photo of my anus, which I can post here, too. 

Other symptoms are chronic diarrhea (since at least 2023--I have a regular bowel movement probably once a month or less), mucus-only BMs occasionally, feeling like I have to poop but nothing comes out (oftentimes not even a fart), and lower back pain (particularly after pooping and lately it can be so bad I have to lean over the counter after to rest for a minute). 

I take Aripiprazole, Clomipramine, and Omeprazole. I have GERD, a Hiatal Hernia, mental health issues, pre-diabetes, NAFLD, Obesity (5'5 and 270lbs), and underactive thyroid (subclinical hypothyroidism but I was being medicated with Levothyroxine up until recently but then I ran out and my prescription expired). 

I had a colonoscopy 2 years ago and all they found was a polyp that was not pre-cancerous. 

As for the photo of my Anus, I had taken one a little over a year ago because I kept feeling pressure on my anus and felt like I was going to poop my pants at night (probably just anxiety in hindsight) and I'll include that, too. In the photo from tonight, there is a bump but in the old photo, around the same area, there is what seems to be like, a skin tag? I'm not sure what it is. It seems like whatever it was though become a pale bump. I tried to feel down there and I couldn't tell if it was squishy or hard. It seemed somewhat firm but I could still press it down. 


Does this just seem like hemorrhoids? Also, sorry if this is just a silly question. I'm just starting to become a little anxious about it.

My rectum pictures during colonoscopy: https://postimg.cc/gallery/XWyvPrZ

What I’m dealing with for 7 years: 
	1. Constant rectal discomfort and pressure
	2.	A disturbing sensation like something is moving inside my rectum
	3.	Persistent itching around the anal and rectal area
	4.	Pelvic soreness and irritation
	5.	Severe changes in sexual function (reduced sensation, very weak orgasms, and overall dysfunction)
      6. Pain in my rectal area and GENITALS. SEVERE PAIN.

This has been going on for a long time, and it’s taking a real toll on me physically and mentally.

Relevant history:
	1.	Positive Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma on a penile swab, but my rectal swab was negative
	2.	Negative tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis
	3.	Previously positive for Candida
	4.	Past gastrointestinal infections (C. difficile, E. coli, H. pylori)
	5. No clear diagnosis so far

My questions:
	1.	Based on the colonoscopy image, could this be fungal/yeast-related, parasitic, infectious proctitis, STI-s (since I was positive on mycoplasma and ureaplasma in penile swap) or something inflammatory?

The lump is about the size of a grape, rubbery (not hard), slightly movable and has no pain. It hasn’t grown in the past 2 months and has stayed the same shape/size and I have no other symptoms. What could this be, is it a knot or something else? 

Edit: When I went to go get the blood work done I obviously asked my doctor to feel my neck, but I told her that my lymph node was swollen (since that’s what I thought it was at the time) and she said that they aren’t and that she couldn’t feel anything.

This went on until two weeks ago i fainted while placing some christmas decor in my dinning room. I freaked out and my husband heard me scream. I was ok but it put me off to something being wrong. I keep up my hydration and i work out regularly as i am in the natl gaurd. I chopped it up to me being nervous (if i was pregnant) or anxiety (generally) and just anxious as my next drill weekend would be crazy as we have been OOO since the govt shutdown and we were fast approaching a very busy weekend of catch up. Despite all this i moved on. 

Fast forward to this past weekend my symptoms began to change. I knew pregnancy was out of the question as inbetween these two weeks i had my period. I was constipated and completely fatigued.

Out of due diligence my doctor ordered a ct scan and im grateful but horrified by the results. 

Hind sight is 20/20...my doctor came in turned off my tv and my nurse sat beside my bed...and grabed my hand. My husband moved closer grabing my arm and then the cross on his neck. She went through my blood work all perfect except when she got to the ct. My nurse clenched my hand..essentially they found a 10.6cm tumor in my liver. 

Fate was on my side as I soon learned that my nurse was back to work after her go with a tumor in her liver 17cm...

I am 26 perfectly healthy beside a little over weight. We werent sure what the tumor my be. The radiology team thinks it a focal nodular hyperplasia (fnh) however mine is quite a bit bigger than average 3cm - 8cm but they can reach my size its just outside of the average. 

I got an mri as well and the findings they think are the same focal nodular hyperplasia (fnh)...but reviewing my records it is ""aytipical"" if it were 100% this type of mass. I have no idea if it is cansorus or not until the biopsy

Essentially im scared i have a consult for a biopsy soon but has anyone been through something similar? Id love to hear any opinion/story good or bad. I havent told anyone besides my immediate family and we are all pretty scared. I am hoping for the best but thought it would help me if i just laid out my story.. thanks ♥️",,,,2025-11-27 06:00:22.848107+00,6,0,null,en,2,2025-11-27 03:03:00,20498,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One spot was biopsied last Thursday. I put antibiotic cream twice daily along with a circular bandaid. I noticed some redness on Saturday (pic 1) and today looks a lot more defined only on the top side (pic 2). 

It doesn't hurt. It doesn't ooze or anything. But the pinkness growing is concerning. Unfortunately, I can't follow up with the dermatology office because in Canada a follow-up will take weeks / months to book. 

- Is this infected? 

- could this be the expanded version of whatever it was taken (eczema, psoriasis, etc)?

- I use a circular bandaid so I would think I'd have a reaction all around not at the top only?

I’m looking for some advice or personal experiences about getting a tattoo while managing Type 2 diabetes. I have plenty of tattoos but they were all done prior to my diagnosis so this is new to me

I’m planning a shin tattoo that will be a mix of a lot of line work plus some blackout and shading. I’m on insulin, and my blood sugars have been relatively within the normal range lately, but I haven’t had my A1C checked in a while. As far as I’m aware, I don’t have any neuropathy. My diabetes originally started as gestational and just never fully went away, so I’m still figuring out what’s “normal” for me long-term.

For anyone with T2D who’s gotten a larger piece—especially on the lower leg—how did it go? Did you take any precautions before or after? Did your artist have any concerns?

I just want to make sure I’m not putting myself at risk for slower healing or infection, so any insight would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",,,,2025-11-27 06:00:22.848107+00,1,0,null,en,0,2025-11-27 05:32:25,20500,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My weight has fluctuated over the last decade or so. I started back then around 288lbs, lost down to about 218lbs then started regaining again. Then had another try a few years later starting at 265lb, got down to 208lb and then started regaining (but slower), then started AGAIN in March at 248lb and now down to 208lb again. 

So this is only the second time I've gotten into the overweight category in my adult life (and the first time I stayed there for about 2 seconds lol). I'm posting to celebrate but also to remind myself I've undone all that regained weight AGAIN and its been tedious af. This is the time to not fuck it up and keep going. 

I'm a lot less restrictive this time and I've definitely had a few periods of maintenance eating rather than deficit, so its taken a while. I've noticed myself getting hungrier lately, so I've just done a couple of weeks at maintenance and now I've set my deficit calories higher for a while. I'm going to focus on things being sustainable from this point even if it means the rest of my weightloss is super slow.

Day to day its usually within like 1-1.5%? biggest swing was after a night of drinking (shocker) but morning readings fasted have been pretty tight. Way less jumpy than my roommates renpho which tells him something different every time. Got a dexa done in like month 2 to compare. Hume said 16.4%, dexa said 17.8 so not exact but closer than i expected for a home scale. Weird thing was the regional breakdown matched pretty well.. both showed my legs holding more fat than torso which tracks, i ran for years before picking up weights

The left/right breakdown has been kinda useful actually? Been doing more unilateral work and can see the gap slowly closing which is cool to quantify vs just feeling it

Muscle mass numbers im less sure about tho. Feels way more variable day to day than bf%. Could be hydration or just BIA being BIA idk

Reasons I suspect this include migraines and cluster headaches, widespread pain but also neck and shoulder pain(including a major problem spot in that specific area), difficulties swallowing, chronic treatment resistant fight or flight/anxiety/depression, chest pains and shortness of breath(tests haven't shown major heart problems so far), stomach dumping syndrome but with chronic constipation, symptoms of POTs but haven't gotten testing for it yet, and some other smaller things. I feel my suspicion is very reasonable and have made an appointment to discuss it and probably get referred out but that will take time. Have already gotten many blood tests, some MRIs, CTs. 

  
My question is: How else can I get a head start on treating this? Online searches feel vague on what I can do for it. I've tried consistent chiropractic and there's definitely nerve compression going on in general but it doesn't seem to help. I attempt to meditate, etc, and I sing daily. My diet has been good. I get plenty of exercise via my job. I take propranolol and it helps a bit on the shortness of breath but not enough. Stuff for gut health like probiotics. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff I'm already doing, I've been desperately trying to feel at LEAST ok and centering my life around it for a while now. What else can I do? What other medications can be considered that aren't simply treating symptoms? How helpful can VNS potentially be at this stage of debilitating problems? The implanted device seems reasonable at this point but it's so expensive, what non-invasive devices may be worth trying? Most of the posts I see about VNS talk more about anxiety and HRV.
