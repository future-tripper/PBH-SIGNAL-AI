  "text": "I'm officially under 200 pounds for the first time in 15 years! Started at 285, had VSG 7 months ago, and today I'm 199.6! I'm crying happy tears. The journey hasn't been easy - lots of adjustments, learning new eating habits, dealing with loose skin - but seeing that 1 on the scale makes it all worth it. To everyone earlier in their journey: keep going, you've got this! Stats: 5'6\" F, SW: 285, CW: 199.6, GW: 160",
