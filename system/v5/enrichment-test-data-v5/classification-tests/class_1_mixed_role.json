  "text": "I'm a bariatric nurse and I also had gastric bypass 2 years ago. In my professional role, I counsel patients about potential complications. But experiencing post-bariatric hypoglycemia myself has been humbling. I tell my patients about PBH symptoms - shakiness, dizziness, sweating - but living with it is different. My own episodes are scary even though I know the clinical facts. I started on acarbose last month and it's helping my symptoms. Strange being on both sides of this condition.",
