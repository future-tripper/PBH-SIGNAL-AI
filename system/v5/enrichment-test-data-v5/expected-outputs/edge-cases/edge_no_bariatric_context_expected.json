  "text": "I've been having episodes of shakiness, sweating, and dizziness about 2 hours after meals. My glucose meter shows readings in the 60s. I don't have diabetes and I've never had any surgeries. Doctor says it might be reactive hypoglycemia and wants me to try dietary changes. Has anyone dealt with this? What helped you?",
