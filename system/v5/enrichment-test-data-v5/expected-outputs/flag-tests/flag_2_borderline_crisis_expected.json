  "text": "I'm having such a hard time today. My PBH has been really bad this week - multiple episodes daily despite being careful with diet. I'm exhausted from the constant vigilance. Sometimes I feel like I can't take this anymore, like it's too much to handle. I know I need to push through but I'm running on empty. Just venting I guess. Tomorrow will be better hopefully. Thanks for listening to my rant.",
