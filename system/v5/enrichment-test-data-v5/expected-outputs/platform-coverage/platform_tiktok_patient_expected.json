  "text": "Day 187 post-VSG and dealing with reactive hypoglycemia is THE WORST. I literally have to eat every 2 hours or I get so shaky and dizzy I can't function. My doctor says it's common after sleeve but nobody warned me about this! Carrying protein snacks everywhere now. Anyone else struggling with this? #vsg #gastricsleeve #postopsideeffects #hypoglycemia",
