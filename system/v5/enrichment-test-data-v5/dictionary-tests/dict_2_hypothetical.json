  "text": "My endo suggested trying avexitide for my post-bariatric hypoglycemia. I'm interested but worried it MIGHT cause nausea or headaches. I've read that some people COULD experience dizziness when starting new medications. Anyone here tried it? Scared it MIGHT make things worse before better. What IF I get bad side effects?",
