  "text": "So I finally got my post-bariatric hypoglycemia under control with acarbose and dietary changes, which is amazing! No more scary drops into the 40s and I can actually function normally most days. I'm so relieved and grateful to my endo for figuring this out. BUT the trade-off is that I have to be incredibly rigid with my eating schedule - I can't skip meals, can't eat out spontaneously without major planning, and I'm constantly thinking about food timing. It's exhausting. Yesterday I had to leave a work meeting early because I could feel my blood sugar dropping and I'd forgotten my snacks. So embarrassing. I guess I'm happy to have found something that works but also frustrated that this is my life now. Anyone else feel this way? Like grateful but also annoyed?",
