  "text": "It's been 8 months since my gastric bypass and I'm finally finding a routine that works for my post-bariatric hypoglycemia. Small frequent meals with protein first, avoiding simple carbs, and using a CGM to track my patterns. Some days are still rough but I'm getting better at managing it. For anyone newly diagnosed - it does get easier as you learn your triggers! My endocrinologist has been amazing. #PBH #BariatricLife #ChronicIllness",
