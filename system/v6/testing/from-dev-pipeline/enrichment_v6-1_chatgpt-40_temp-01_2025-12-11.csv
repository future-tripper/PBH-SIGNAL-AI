There was a lot of anxiety leading up to the surgery but the main point of the quality of her life and health improving helped to alleviate a lot of those worries. Thank God, it went smoothly and she’s currently recovering in the ward. I joined this community just to get more understanding on the day to day. I think this is an amazing and affirming space. 

I was wondering if anyone had some advice for those caring for people who have had the surgery? What was the 2 week diet progression like? What would you recommend I do?

We work together and I notice that she barely eats anything at all and I’m quite concerned. 

We had a chat today which she initiated because I generally chose not to comment on people’s bodies and she’s basically said that her team advised at her last check in that if she lost more they would need to tube feed her. Since then she’s gone on to lose another stone and recons she is only eating 500-600 kcals a day. Her reasoning is that she just doesn’t feel hungry anymore and food gives no pleasure, in the past she has mentioned that she hates the feeling of food being stuck which puts her off eating. 

I don’t really know how to support her, I asked what I could do and she said nothing. I’ve offered to bring food in for her or remind her to regularly eat but she said it won’t help.

She is unfortunately struggling to get solid support from her healthcare provider. I am looking to understand as much as I can to make sure we are making the most informed decisions possible.

  
**Some context:**

She is in her 70s and does not yet have any continuous glucose monitor (CGM), so she is routinely pricking her finger many times (10+) a day as she learns to manage her diet appropriately. She has some glucose tablets as well that she uses if her blood sugar drops below 80, which seems like is around where she starts to feel a little dizzy or light-headed.

She is trying to be very cautious about what she eats, but after meals with some (non-simple or refined) carbohydrates (limited to 1/4 cup/meal) she still has some blood sugar dips. 

  
**Questions:**

1. She is working with her doctor to try and understand the cause, but in the meantime is looking to get a CGM. From what I've gathered so far, Dexcom G6/G7 seems to be what we should be after. Is this the right way to go?
2. Currently she is avoiding food about 4 hours before bed and seems to have positive results. I am getting mixed opinions on whether or not this is good. On one hand, a low glycemic index, slow digesting carb, seems like it would make sure blood sugar stays good throughout the night. On the other, until we have solid predictability, it sounds dangerous to eat anything. Does it sound safe for her to continue to have a significant fasting window before bed? I was not too hapy to find recently 3 hours after breakfast her blood sugar was down to \~70. I did confirm with her what she ate, and it wasn't the best choice - some kind of healthy-oritented muffin that had a few ingredients considered ""medium"" glycemic index, and coffee w/ milk (that part should be OK?)
3. My understanding is that glucose tablets **do not** affect insulin production and is safe to take them when it is low. And while sugary drinks may temporarily resolve low blood sugar, they will trigger another crash, specifically because this is reactive hypoglycemia. Does this sound accurate?
4. Are thre any good resources for learning more about this topic that can help with making better decisions? I have a general understanding of the mechanisms behind reactive hypoglycemia but would be happy to learn more. Technical is OK. I am not a medical professional but I am in STEM and have research experience.

At first I was worried because I wasn’t feeling full when I ate, and my dietitian made it worse by saying I was eating twice as much as her other patients, even though I was following my clinic’s guidelines. Now there’s a suspicion of a stricture because I often vomit and feel like food gets stuck. My surgeon wants to wait 2–3 more weeks before considering an endoscopy, and tomorrow will be one month since my surgery.

I feel overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. I just want to live a normal life like other people my age, but ever since the sleeve and now the bypass, I feel stuck in a bubble while everyone else moves forward. It weighs heavily on me. I’ve also only lost one kilo in the last two weeks, and I’m really not doing well. Has anyone else had repeated vomiting and that stuck feeling around 4 weeks post-op?

34,reddit.com,t3_1pfed9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pfed9p/post_anaesthesia_psychosisdelirium/,Post anaesthesia psychosis/delirium.,"I was hoping to get some insight into something that happened to me after an operation in 2019, to satisfy my own curiosity, and to know if I should inform medical staff of it in the future.

In 2019, I was put under general anaesthetic to have my left ovary removed, due to multiple cysts on it, over several years prior. I have had surgeries under GA before, with no issues, or bad reactions to anaesthesia.

I have always remembered waking up in recovery, after any previous surgeries, and being aware of being taken back to my hospital ward. After this surgery, however, (which had no complications), the first thing I recall is waking up in a private room, with my mother and several nurses present, and feeling a violent and overwhelming sense of panic.

I have decades of experience of surgeries and procedures, and this wasn't simply waking up in pain and being distressed. It was like I'd lost my mind. From what I have been told, I wouldn't let anyone near me when I woke up on my original ward, and started trying to lash out at staff who got close to me, and yelling at them to get away from me. At that point, my next of kin was called, I was moved to a private room, and that's where my recollection begins.

All I can recall is that every time a staff member came in, or tried to calm me, I would back up the bed and try and cower from them. It was a feeling of terror I haven't been able to ever truly describe. According to my next of kin, I was begging for everyone to leave, would violently react if anyone tried to touch me, and was acting completely and utterly opposite to the person I am. I can only describe it as feeling like a caged animal, who didn't know where it was, and didn't trust anyone. I can only liken it to the aggressive behaviour/personality shifts that I've witnessed in dementia patients, or those with brain injuries.

After several hours, I must have fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion, and all I recall is waking up the next morning, absolutely normal again. I was talking to staff politely and cheerfully, apologising profusely for what happened, and every staff member was shocked at the difference in me. What had been like a shift in mental status, was completely back to normal, some 24 hours after surgery.

It was never truly explained to me what had happened, and it has always left me unsettled. I have seen (from Dr. Google), that post-op delirium is something that exists, and I would be curious if any medical professionals have heard of or seen this before, and have any insight into causes, or whether it is entirely random, and whether (since it has happened once) it could happen again. I appreciate any input, as it still freaks me out to this day!

14,reddit.com,t3_1pc4ziz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1pc4ziz/second_small_bowel_strangulation_and_emergency/,Second small bowel strangulation and emergency surgery in less than 5 months,"I had an RNY gastric bypass back in 2002. After 23 years, I had a small bowel strangulation in July.  Went to the ER and had a CT scan and emergency surgery. My original RNY bypassed area had apparently fallen a bit causing a hernia thay my intestines lopped around and eventually got twisted on, cutting off blood flow. It was the absolute most painful thing I have ever experienced. All went okay after surgery. I did not lose any bowel. It all ""pinked up"" after being untwisted. I did have a 6"" midline open incision. Spent a week in the hospital after but recovery went very well.  I thought I had survived a ""once in a lifetime "" event. 

Apparently not. In early November, just 4 months later, it happened again. Though this time instead of my intestines wrapping around a hernia from the RNY structure, it got caught on the scar tissue that formed after the surgery from July and developed a kink in the intestines that cut off blood flow again. This was less painful. For the first few hours, it felt like a regular old RNY ""dumping"" syndrome after eating something fatty like pizza. I had gone though that many times over the years - pain, pouring sweat, shaking. It was usually 4 hours on my hands and knees on the bathroom floor and some vomiting while waiting for it to pass. But this time it didn't pass. It got worse. After 5 hours, I figured it was something else and went to the ER. It was another strangulation.  Another CT scan and another surgery. This time, I lost a little over a foot of small intestines and came close to sepsis. I was given the strongest antibiotics they have via IV for days. I spent another week in the hospital.  This time, recovery is much slower and more painful. They went through the same 6"" midline incision. I have had  symptoms of bowel inflammation for a month now and can eat very little. I have lost 25 lbs - all muscle. I have weird little pains throughout my abdomen and mild nausea, but am able to eat a little and drink water and I do have bowel movements now, so things are moving along. But I don't get much sleep and trying to recover is still dominating my life.

The thing is, I feel like a ticking time bomb now. The surgeon said this was functionally different than the first strangulation. This one, while rare, can still happen to anyone who has had any  abdominal surgery and has internal scar tissue. But yes,  it can happen again. The only way to monitor it or tell if something is going wrong is another CT scan. You can only have so many of those in a year because of the amount of radiation. Basically, there is nothing I can do to prevent it from happening again at any time. I went from feeling so relieved and grateful at have survived the first one to now feeling like someone in a Final Destination movie, afraid that someday I won't make it to surgery in time. 

When a strangulation happens like this, the only treatment is emergency surgery to manually remove the blockage/twist. Since blood flow is cut off, the intestines can start dying within hours. If not treated fast enough, the intestines will die (as part of mine did this time) and eventually rupture, causing sepsis and death. I am afraid to travel or take a cruise or go anywhere more than an hour from a large hospital.

If you want more details:

I rested for 2 weeks, went back to uni on the 15th day, on the third week i noticed persistent pain, ultrasound said it was a mild Inflamation and small hydrocele, got prescribed antibiotics for 10 days, and the inflammation resolved.

on about 5 weeks post op I noticed something grey on the incision area(I thought it was fully closed) and pulled it thinking it was dirt, then i noticed the opening, and freaked out, my doctor said its alright and it'll close on its own, however its been  months now, its still there.

It does not hurt on its own, though it tenses up when sneezing, it burns with friction, when irritated, wearing something tight or when stretching/uncomfortable positions.

my balls also hurt, slightly when i strain, sit somewhere uncomfortable, or wear something tight. though the oain usually goes away slowly when i change positions, or change my clothes.

 currently not doing much physical activity beside walking, though i usually rest a little when it starts to hurt.

I always classified as “obese” at almost every year in life  that I can remember. Getting scolded by doctors that I was too heavy for my age, early menstruation at age 8, started Birth control at age 11 for irregular periods/ hormones, PCOS, diabetes high cholesterol, diabetes, the whole metabolic syndrome package. 

Hispanic heritage and traditions, and now after therapy ( still in therapy) some various traumas led to food as comfort, of course can’t blame everything on trauma and environment, but food was my vice. 
So at 5’1 and 365lbs at age 19 I was the youngest in my area (SoCal) to qualify for the RNY gastric bypass at this time . Had a whole team of surgeons, consent to video, medical students, literally a medical academic show. 

I was not a smooth recovery, strictures, ulcers, gallstones, gallbladder removal (2013), I lost weight VERY quickly and was a frequent flyer at that hospital for electrolyte imbalance ( mainly potassium), and malnutrition issues. In 9 months I had lost 110 ish pounds 
Finally after 2014 my body got used to the new digestive set up and dumping syndrome. I think my lowest weight was 160

Went to college, went to nursing school 2017- stress and eating filler food had me gaining again. Mind you my stomach never stretched and I dumped at every sugary/greasy meal. Yet somehow still went all the way back to 240 in 2023 ( does a break up of a 5 year relationship contribute too? Maybe?). 

Forgot the whole purpose of RNY was a “tool”,  and tried to do low carb started losing weight slowly. Current situation dysfunction of oddi! Because of my anatomy that little sphincter in the Biliary tree is acting up and I’ve been having. Gallbladder phantom pain for the last year. Like the pain that radiates to shoulder and you’re immobile.  

Had to find an experienced endoscopist (took a whole year) that is comfy doing an ERCP with gastric bypass anatomy. Had some thing called the EGDE Procedure  with stent placement ( part 1) 11/10 going to have part 2 12/10 to cut that sphincter and take out the stent. If I can attach a pic of the procedure I will.

Just wanted to see if there are any other long timers on here who have long term issues after 10+years post op

38,reddit.com,t3_1pftder,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1pftder/out_of_options/,Out of options,"Ya'll, I wrote this in response to someone else's post on: How did you know you were ready for gastric bypass surgery? I ended up writing more than I intended but I wanted to post separately in case others out there need to hear this: 

I'm hoping to get the surgery in May 2026.

Here's what has led me to this point: in 2017, I had lost over 100 lbs and had the tummy tuck to cut away a very large and droopy apron of fat that had just been hanging after the weight loss (like, seriously, I looked better when I was fat because it at least filled the apron).  After that was cut away, I loved the way my stomach looked and maintained (almost my goal weight) around three years. My goal was 150. I was at 170. But I felt amazing, I could go to any store and just about know that they have something there for me that would fit and look amazing. I had so much energy, and I had a healthy relationship with food and exercise. 

I had been working as a college instructor (several adjunct/ part-time positions at a time) and decided to take a full-time job teaching high school around 2021. That's when literally everything went to shit. Teaching consumed my entire life. Since students ate in our classroom (due to the pandemic) and planning period was replaced by enrichment (also due to the pandemic), the only time I had to plan was weekends and evenings. I was living in survival mode. 

Most of the time, I forgot to eat until I was on my way home because I had no downtime at work, so I would stop and get Sonic or whatever was convenient. I would buy dinner for my family but I would eat a small burger and a pretzel stick otw home and then eat again with them (so I was buying like a pre meal to account for my skipped lunch and another meal). Then, I would graze in the kitchen for a while before bed. I basically went all day without food and then binged when I got home.  

The stress and burnout from the job was ruining my life. I thought things couldn't be worse until I went to the doctor for intense face pain I'd recently developed, and she told me I had a condition called Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), which is incurable but could be relieved with medications and surgery. Eventually, I was up to almost 3000 gabapentin and 900 Oxcarbazapine per day. These meds cause drowsiness and can increase hunger. Add that to the work stress, I had went from 170-220 in a span of 2 years. 

Then, in 2023, I had my first brain surgery, which caused me to put on another 30 lbs, but once I got back to work, all of the 30 lbs went away. When that surgery failed, I had a second brain surgery 6 months later and put on exactly 30 lbs again. 

I left that job for a MUCH more stable and calm position, but the weight did not come off like it did after the first surgery. I stayed at 250 despite having a nutritionist for over a year and trying to stay consistent with gym visits. I struggle with having energy because some days (particularly very cold days), my face feels like I'm being electrocuted, so I have to increase meds to cope. The second surgery helped a lot, but evidently not from the cold. However, in the summer, I can just about come off the meds completely!

Additionally, over the last year, I developed firbroids that had been growing inside of my uterus, causing it to grow 400× the normal size of a uterus, so I began experiencing intense fibroid pain and bleeding that interfered with everything in my life. I avoided any type of plans the last two weeks out of a month because I would have random 10/10 pain that required me to sit on a heating pad until it passed (usually 10-20 min). Because of that, I'm about to have a total hysterectomy, and honestly, it can't come soon enough! I've been counting down the days. I'm getting it later this month (thank God!). 

So, for a year now, I've been juggling my life around not one, but two very different, very severe pain conditions. 

Given my history of weight gain after surgery, I'm worried about this going in. Currently, I'm at 260. I know losing weight becomes more difficult after a hysterectomy. And then there's this: I've dealt with high blood pressure since I was in my 20s (I'm now 41), and I've recently been placed in the pre-diabetic range. I'm tired all the time, my feet hurt more often than not, and I often feel zaps in my feet (kind of like the TN pain in my face) in bed at night that make it hard to sleep. In looking into this, I've found out that is a symptom of diabetes. 

As of now, I'm mostly considered still healthy, but I know if things don't change, it will get much worse. I have been through so much pain already. Much more than most people will ever experience. I dont say that to brag. TN is known as the ""suicide disease"" because people will hurt so bad they accidentally overdose on the meds used to manage the pain. I believe that because I have been rushed to the ER more than a few times when the pain reaches a point to where you just want to end it. Not because you want to die or you're depressed, but because you just want the pain to end and you can't think of anything else. 

I know that gastric bypass surgery or weight loss doesn't necessarily cure that, but it will drastically decrease the amount of inflammation in my body caused by food, which (I believe and hope) will decrease the amount of pain. I'm doing this so I can have more pain-free days. I'm doing it so I can get out of the pre-diabetic range. So I can stand on my feet without experiencing so much pain. So I can have more energy again to do the things I enjoy with my family without always feeling like I'm sacrificing comfort. I'm doing it so I can hopefully lower my blood pressure. So I can enjoy my life again. So I can live longer. So I can fit in real clothes again instead of always settling for leggings and a t-shirt dress or stretchy pants. I know there are risks involved, but I think I'm at a good window of space in time where I can still turn some things around, and in my case, the benefits outweigh the risks. 

So I'm at a point where I'm asking, ""What could go wrong if I don't get this surgery,"" instead of the other way around.",,,,2025-12-09 08:09:37.933216+00,3,0,,en,1,2025-12-06 16:30:51,,,,,"[""bariatric_surgery""]","[""weakness""]",[],[],[],"[""gastric bypass surgery"",""trigeminal neuralgia"",""fibroid pain"",""weight regain after surgery"",""pre-diabetic range""]",borderline,0.7,Strong bariatric context (upcoming gastric bypass surgery) but no PBH/hypoglycemia indicators,patient,0.8,"[""Bariatric Surgery"",""Symptoms""]",negative,0.8,"[""frustration"",""hope""]","[""sharing_experience"",""seeking_advice""]",[],"[""topics_bariatric_surgery_034"",""symptoms_weakness_023""]",,strong,5,low,true,

I sprained my L ankle pretty badly about 4-5 years ago stepping on a small pinecone. That time it was pretty bad and I resprained it during that healing process.

In mid October I sprained it again by stepping out of my front door with my dogs. Just stepped on it wrong. I was able to put weight on it within about 15min and did the RICE protocol. Major pain stopped within the day,  and majority of swelling went down within 3. My ankle still has a swollen lump in front of the ankle bone (between my pinky toe and lateral malleolus), is stiff, and achy.

My mental health deteriorated earlier this year over three months when I started wegovy. I started cycling rapidly between hypomania and depression which continued to get worse until I realised that it was affecting the absorption of my oral medication. I stopped the wegovy, but instead of getting better, I continued to get worse. I ended up getting fired from my job because I literally could not sit at a desk so wasn't getting any work done, and my increasingly erratic behaviour.

I keep a very detailed tracker of my mood, including things like mood, affect, and sleep. I now have enough data to do analysis and identify patterns and correlations. The most common symptoms logged were some variation of restlessness, agitation, and tired but wired. 

It got to the point a few weeks ago where I was constantly pacing, feeling like I was crawling out of my skin, and intense dysphoria as well as anxiety about going to bed, and mental agony if i wasn't moving. I didn't sleep for five days, stopped being able to eat, and 24 hours a day I paced up and down my one bedroom apartment (9 steps long) until I was too exhausted to walk, so then I put on knee pads because I have a tiled floor and crawled up and down until I was too exhausted even for that I just lay on the floor and cried until I had enough energy to get up and do it all again. It was literally torture. 

I ended up going to the urgent clinic because I was having excruciating pain localised to the rectum and passing just bloody mucus. However, the doctor was very alarmed about my mental state and saw I was about to tip into manic psychosis, so sent me to the emergency department in a taxi. I was so dysphoric and restless that I left before being triaged. I was sent back that night but left again after 3.5 hours and walked home in the rain at 3.30am because I was convinced that everyone in the waiting room was whispering about and laughing at me. I thought that an elderly woman in a wheelchair was a suicide bomber. I also started to think that I should upload my mind to the cloud and do away with my physical body so I could exist just as a mind. 

When I left during the day, I was too exhausted to keep walking, but I happened to be outside the community mental health clinic so I crawled into the lift and dragged myself out. at this point I had lost my shoes and a lot of my clothes somewhere along the way. I went to the bathroom, and with absolutely no thought or consideration I ripped off my belt and tried to hang myself from the hook on the back of the door. Obviously it didn't hold my weight and broke. When I landed on the floor I thought ""phew, I'm glad that didn't work.""

The third doctor I saw about the rectum issue was also very alarmed at my mental state and sent me back to hospital with my aunt who stayed with me to make sure I didn't leave again. I was so restless and in pain from my rectum that I couldn't sit or lie down, but eventually I was so exhausted that I was lying on the floor of the ED waiting room still writhing in mental and physical agony for 6 hours. Finally I got seen and given 10mg of diazepam so I could be still enough for a CT. it gave me relief for nearly 20 hours. Nothing was found in the CT or stool sample, but it cleared up on its own so who the fuck knows what that was about. 

I saw a psychiatrist as a one off assessment who diagnosed me with severe akathisia as well as rapid cycling mood. It finally all made sense. 

So far I've been taking orphenadrine at night and procyclidine during the day with diazepam for if things get unbearable. They worked really well for five days, then I kept waking up after 3 hours and the procyclidine was only giving relief for a couple of hours and i can only take twice a day. I'm getting intense and very distressing break through symptoms. It's so awful but I have to be careful with the diazepam because it gives complete relief for at least 12 hours and I'm tempted to just take it all the time to ease the pain. When it's bad, any kind of stimulation exacerbates intensely so I couldn't go outside and needed silence. 

Last night it was really bad and I put dumbbells in two backpacks and zip tied then on to me. I walked up and down the waterfront for a couple of hours until i managed to get myself home. Today, I was walking across a bridge, and again with no thought I jumped onto the railing and was about to jump off when two members of the public dragged me back. I ran away to avoid the police. 

I don't actually want to die, but when it gets bad I get extremely impulsively suicidal. I truly believe that I'm going to go through with it with no warning which would be so tragic given that most of the time I'm not actually that consciously suicidal. I honestly don't know what I can do to stop it. It's kind of even more dangerous than a suicidal person with a plan because it could happen any time anywhere with no way to prevent it. 

I've been given some alternative treatment options which I'm not feeling happy about - propranolol (which I've taken before and hated because it felt like I couldn't breathe and was going to die), mirtazapine (which is ill advised given the bipolar), or changing whatever drug it is that I'm taking that is the offender. Coming off or reducing the dose of olanzapine much is not an option. If I didn't have the injection of it I'd be manic in the stratosphere after days of not sleeping at all, but I  could feel that the ceiling it provides was going to crack. 

I can now get a few hours sleep with the orphenadrine, but I'm pretty desperate to find something more effective that works for longer than a few hours. I'm softening to the idea of propranolol, but would be very appreciative if someone could give me some more options for relief, because this is hard to convey, but it's literally torture. 

I don't know what I can do about the impulsive suicide attempts except for effectively treating the akathisia. I'm just at a loss and so exhausted that I may not be able to hold on much longer.

Any potential solution or just something that eases some of the suffering would be so much appreciated.

(I called him ""Pee wee"").  I'm told that at 6 months I'll reach some level of normal/stability with this.  Right now, I'm having so many weird sensations that I can't always identify.  Sleeping is still hit or miss.  Every time I eat or drink I have a mild discomfort of some sort or another; nothing major but I've always been hyper-aware of abdominal glitches since my history of Barretts Esophagus kicked in 30 yrs ago.  Usually walking helps.  Every little pain sets off the questioning ""did I eat too much?""  ""is this dumping syndrome or something stuck?""  I'm in the process of tapering off of PPI's, since I was on them for so many years.  I really doubt it's reflux I'm feeling, but I can't rule it out.

Maybe I should just chalk it up to normal post-op adjustments, but the curse of being a nurse is this madness I'm putting myself through.",,,,2025-12-09 08:09:37.933216+00,1,0,,en,0,2025-11-30 17:11:19,,,,,"[""bariatric_surgery""]",[],[],[],[],"[""post-op RNY"",""teeny tiny pouch"",""post-op adjustments"",""abdominal glitches"",""tapering off PPI's"",""dumping syndrome""]",borderline,0.7,Strong bariatric context (RNY surgery) but no PBH/hypoglycemia indicators,patient,0.8,"[""Bariatric Surgery""]",mixed,0.8,"[""frustration"",""hope""]","[""sharing_experience""]",[],"[""topics_bariatric_surgery_034"",""audience_anchor_patient_anchor_001""]",,strong,1,low,true,
