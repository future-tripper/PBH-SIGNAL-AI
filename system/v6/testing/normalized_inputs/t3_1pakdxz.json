  "text": "I had a VSG one year ago and am down 60 pounds! My doctor\u2019s goal was 100 pounds down total, but that last 40 seems so far away at this point. \nI\u2019m very proud of the progress I\u2019ve made! And I\u2019ve been stuck at 225 for 6 months. I\u2019ve talked to my medical team and their advice is always the same \u201cjust keep eating protein and drinking water,\u201d which I am doing! I\u2019ve been exercising more and specifically lifting more weights! \nHas anyone else had a long stall? Did anything break it?",
