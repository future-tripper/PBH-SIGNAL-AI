  "text": "Folks, I\u2019m 100 days post Lap OAGB. Lost 66 pounds or 30 kilos in the time period. I used to smoke, but quit it 2 months before the surgery. There are days I feel like restarting cigarette smoking but when I read about possible issues, I don\u2019t go for it. But I want to have something similar to smoking but way safer. Given that I\u2019m 100 days post surgery recovering and losing weight, can I take up vaping? Is vaping better than smoking? What probable or possible risks are there in vaping after gastric bypass?",
