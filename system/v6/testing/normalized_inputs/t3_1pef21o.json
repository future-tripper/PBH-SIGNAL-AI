  "text": "I hope this is okay to post. I'm looking for opinions from people who have gone through this before. \n\n\nI have the option to go with medicine (such as Wegovy) or a sleeve. The Dr said my BMI is right at 35 so he would support whatever way I decide. \n\n\nI'm trying to weigh the best choice for me. (According to the doctor) Medicine will work for one to two years then most people see weight creep back on -- and it'll likely give me a 20-30 pound loss. Surgery has risks but it'll be more successful long-term. I'm hoping to lose 70-80 pounds. \n\n\nMy concerns with surgery, though, are:\n\n\n\u2022 What my down time would be? I have 3 kids so it'll be difficult to not be able to do much or drive. I was told I'd need help for 2 or 3 days but I'm not sure if that's realistic\n\n\n\u2022 How is your diet afterwards? I can't remember exactly what I was told as far as length of time, but he said a liquid diet at first and then mainly protein after that. Someone I know who has had this done told me they aren't supposed to eat any junk food or carbonated beverages ever again or else they will vomit. Is that true? \n\n\nMy husband doesn't really want me to have surgery. He said I should just try harder to lose weight, so that's making me second guess myself.\n\n\nThanks for the insight!",
