  "text": "Hey everyone. \n\nMy mother\u2019s just had her gastric bypass. I\u2019ve been caring for her for most of my life - I\u2019m 25m. There was a lot of anxiety leading up to the surgery but the main point of the quality of her life and health improving helped to alleviate a lot of those worries. Thank God, it went smoothly and she\u2019s currently recovering in the ward. I joined this community just to get more understanding on the day to day. I think this is an amazing and affirming space. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had some advice for those caring for people who have had the surgery? What was the 2 week diet progression like? What would you recommend I do? Are there any absolute do\u2019s/don\u2019ts? From my many interrogations with doctors, I know about the vitamins, dumping etc - but I wanted some insights from those who have been through it. \n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated! \n\nMy mother and I are based in London, England.",
