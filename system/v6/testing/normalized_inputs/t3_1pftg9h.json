  "text": "Hi y\u2019all! I\u2019m 3 yrs post RnY and I finally hit my goal weight and can have skin removal. I\u2019m doing the upper body first, the lower body next June and thighs next fall. I\u2019m very nervous, but SO ready for this new phase of my transformation. I was 286 at my heaviest and I\u2019m now 145. Don\u2019t give up! The work pays off!",
