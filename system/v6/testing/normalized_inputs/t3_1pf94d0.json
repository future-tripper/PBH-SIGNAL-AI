  "text": "hello, i'm 1 year &amp; 6 months post op. i'm down 160 lbs &amp; have been doing and feel great for the past year. I've been pretty careful with what I eat (obviously) but today I accidentally swallowed a piece of gum. I am trying very hard to not freak myself out but I would like to know if I should be concerned or not. I am very much a hypochondriac lol, and sometimes just hearing from someone else that i'll be fine helps. ty in advance",
