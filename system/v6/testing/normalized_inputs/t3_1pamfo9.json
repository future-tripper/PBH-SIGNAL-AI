  "text": "I had gastric bypass on March 24, 2025. My starting weight was 367 and I am down to 207. I went from a size 28 to a 12 in pants and a 3xl to large in shirts. I am happy with where I\u2019m at right now, but I cannot find a bra! My breasts have lost all the volume but there\u2019s so much excess skin left. What are people doing for bras?",
