  "text": "I'm about 60 days post-op RNY and I'm learning (or trying) to make peace with my teeny tiny pouch of a stomach.  (I called him \"Pee wee\").  I'm told that at 6 months I'll reach some level of normal/stability with this.  Right now, I'm having so many weird sensations that I can't always identify.  Sleeping is still hit or miss.  Every time I eat or drink I have a mild discomfort of some sort or another; nothing major but I've always been hyper-aware of abdominal glitches since my history of Barretts Esophagus kicked in 30 yrs ago.  Usually walking helps.  Every little pain sets off the questioning \"did I eat too much?\"  \"is this dumping syndrome or something stuck?\"  I'm in the process of tapering off of PPI's, since I was on them for so many years.  I really doubt it's reflux I'm feeling, but I can't rule it out.\n\nMaybe I should just chalk it up to normal post-op adjustments, but the curse of being a nurse is this madness I'm putting myself through.",
