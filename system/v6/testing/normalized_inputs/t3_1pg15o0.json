  "text": "Hi! My baby was recently diagnosed with hypoinsulinemia after he had bowel surgery and I don\u2019t believe he is truly hypoglycemic or as the endo team says he is hypoinsulinemia. He is a cardiac baby with a rare heart defect and has pretty wonky perfusion due to his circulation and he was post op when they did testing. For instance he had a heel prick test result of 46 right after he was fed and it led them to freaking out so I requested a finger prick result and it was 2 minutes later and it was 76.. they want to base everything off of heel prick reading results but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s accurate due to his circulatory perfusion etc. which area would be most accurate for testing blood sugars? Heel or finger? Thank you for any insight I am a nervous new mom with a medically complex baby and seeking any insight from those with personal experience with low blood sugars etc!",
