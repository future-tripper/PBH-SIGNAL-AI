  "text": "I'm not proud to say I severely cheated by skipping to the final stage 8 days into post op. I ate a few pieces of chicken and a pepper or two my fiance had made and after reading all the horrible stories, I forced myself to throw up what I could, which was just the chicken. I'm terrified I could have harmed myself (thankfully I don't feel any uncomfortable feelings in my body aside from anxiety and regret). How will I know? Is it immediate or does it take some time to appear? I have been a little on the gassy side and have been burping a bit. I'm not looking to get shamed, I just would like some support through this. I'm struggling tremendously and have already cried about it two nights in a row. This addiction is killing me emotionally. I haven't even had my post op appointment yet, I will on Monday. I feel horribly guilty and I'm worried it's going to happen again.",
