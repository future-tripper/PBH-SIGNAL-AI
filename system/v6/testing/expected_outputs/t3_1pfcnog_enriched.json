  "text": "9 weeks post op. The last month my ADHD medicine has not been working, maybe even all of them. Even before surgery I didnt get the full effect because I take omeprazole. \n\nI see a therapist weekly. \n\nSaw pych earlier in the week and we switched stimulants, she said I could crush them since they are not extended release. I am getting more stable. Um it would have been really nice if someone told me that I should do that! lol  \n\nWe are trying to get a transdermal patch. I've seen others use that after gastric bypass. Well, why the heck am I getting the runaround getting my script filled. They claim they've never filled that med before and so they cant make any promises filling it. They recommended I go to a specialty pharmacy. Okay I did that and they dont \"deal\" with that class of medications.  \n\n  \nI am really frustrated....Like why even have that medication \"available\" if it wont/cant be filled???\n\n  \nOpen to suggestions",
