  "text": "Hi so i'm 19M and I'm 5'4 and weigh 185 lbs after deciding to hold off on self medicating with a chemical called DNP i've turned to this sub for advise so  I've struggled with my weight for a few years now When I rapidly gained nearly 50 over a period of 9 months after starting a medication called Zyprexa I've since stopped taking this but I have not lost the weight I started on Ozempic and attempted to make lifestyle changes around a year ago and lost with some difficulty 10 pounds which I have since kept off I'm struggling to lose any more weight and I honestly don't believe any weight loss resulted from the ozempic and I have had some side effects. I'm looking for a medication to Ideally replace the ozempic but I would also continue the ozempic with a new medication if that gives the best chance of success. The medication would also have to be able to be taken alongside my other medications which include:\n\nLithium, Vyvanse, Zofran and Vilazodone\n\nI would appreciate any advice on medications that could be tried and how to have a conversation like this with my prescriber whom I see around every 4 months&gt;!&amp;#x200B;!&lt;",
