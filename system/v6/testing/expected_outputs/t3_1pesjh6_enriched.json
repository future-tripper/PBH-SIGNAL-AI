  "text": "F39, taking olanzapine (long acting injection and pills), lamotrigine, and nortriptyline for bipolar disorder, atogepant for chronic migraines, metformin for a recent diagnosis of diabetes caused by olanzapine, tapering off pregabalin, and various drugs that I will detail below. \n\nMy mental health deteriorated earlier this year over three months when I started wegovy. I started cycling rapidly between hypomania and depression which continued to get worse until I realised that it was affecting the absorption of my oral medication. I stopped the wegovy, but instead of getting better, I continued to get worse. I ended up getting fired from my job because I literally could not sit at a desk so wasn't getting any work done, and my increasingly erratic behaviour.\n\nI keep a very detailed tracker of my mood, including things like mood, affect, and sleep. I now have enough data to do analysis and identify patterns and correlations. The most common symptoms logged were some variation of restlessness, agitation, and tired but wired. \n\nIt got to the point a few weeks ago where I was constantly pacing, feeling like I was crawling out of my skin, and intense dysphoria as well as anxiety about going to bed, and mental agony if i wasn't moving. I didn't sleep for five days, stopped being able to eat, and 24 hours a day I paced up and down my one bedroom apartment (9 steps long) until I was too exhausted to walk, so then I put on knee pads because I have a tiled floor and crawled up and down until I was too exhausted even for that I just lay on the floor and cried until I had enough energy to get up and do it all again. It was literally torture. \n\nI ended up going to the urgent clinic because I was having excruciating pain localised to the rectum and passing just bloody mucus. However, the doctor was very alarmed about my mental state and saw I was about to tip into manic psychosis, so sent me to the emergency department in a taxi. I was so dysphoric and restless that I left before being triaged. I was sent back that night but left again after 3.5 hours and walked home in the rain at 3.30am because I was convinced that everyone in the waiting room was whispering about and laughing at me. I thought that an elderly woman in a wheelchair was a suicide bomber. I also started to think that I should upload my mind to the cloud and do away with my physical body so I could exist just as a mind. \n\nWhen I left during the day, I was too exhausted to keep walking, but I happened to be outside the community mental health clinic so I crawled into the lift and dragged myself out. at this point I had lost my shoes and a lot of my clothes somewhere along the way. I went to the bathroom, and with absolutely no thought or consideration I ripped off my belt and tried to hang myself from the hook on the back of the door. Obviously it didn't hold my weight and broke. When I landed on the floor I thought \"phew, I'm glad that didn't work.\"\n\nThe third doctor I saw about the rectum issue was also very alarmed at my mental state and sent me back to hospital with my aunt who stayed with me to make sure I didn't leave again. I was so restless and in pain from my rectum that I couldn't sit or lie down, but eventually I was so exhausted that I was lying on the floor of the ED waiting room still writhing in mental and physical agony for 6 hours. Finally I got seen and given 10mg of diazepam so I could be still enough for a CT. it gave me relief for nearly 20 hours. Nothing was found in the CT or stool sample, but it cleared up on its own so who the fuck knows what that was about. \n\nI saw a psychiatrist as a one off assessment who diagnosed me with severe akathisia as well as rapid cycling mood. It finally all made sense. \n\nSo far I've been taking orphenadrine at night and procyclidine during the day with diazepam for if things get unbearable. They worked really well for five days, then I kept waking up after 3 hours and the procyclidine was only giving relief for a couple of hours and i can only take twice a day. I'm getting intense and very distressing break through symptoms. It's so awful but I have to be careful with the diazepam because it gives complete relief for at least 12 hours and I'm tempted to just take it all the time to ease the pain. When it's bad, any kind of stimulation exacerbates intensely so I couldn't go outside and needed silence. \n\nLast night it was really bad and I put dumbbells in two backpacks and zip tied then on to me. I walked up and down the waterfront for a couple of hours until i managed to get myself home. Today, I was walking across a bridge, and again with no thought I jumped onto the railing and was about to jump off when two members of the public dragged me back. I ran away to avoid the police. \n\nI don't actually want to die, but when it gets bad I get extremely impulsively suicidal. I truly believe that I'm going to go through with it with no warning which would be so tragic given that most of the time I'm not actually that consciously suicidal. I honestly don't know what I can do to stop it. It's kind of even more dangerous than a suicidal person with a plan because it could happen any time anywhere with no way to prevent it. \n\nI've been given some alternative treatment options which I'm not feeling happy about - propranolol (which I've taken before and hated because it felt like I couldn't breathe and was going to die), mirtazapine (which is ill advised given the bipolar), or changing whatever drug it is that I'm taking that is the offender. Coming off or reducing the dose of olanzapine much is not an option. If I didn't have the injection of it I'd be manic in the stratosphere after days of not sleeping at all, but I  could feel that the ceiling it provides was going to crack. \n\nI can now get a few hours sleep with the orphenadrine, but I'm pretty desperate to find something more effective that works for longer than a few hours. I'm softening to the idea of propranolol, but would be very appreciative if someone could give me some more options for relief, because this is hard to convey, but it's literally torture. \n\nI don't know what I can do about the impulsive suicide attempts except for effectively treating the akathisia. I'm just at a loss and so exhausted that I may not be able to hold on much longer.\n\nAny potential solution or just something that eases some of the suffering would be so much appreciated. \n\nPlease, I'm begging for someone to help me before it's too late.",
