  "text": "I\u2019ve noticed my stomach has become more sensitive lately. It has been making sounds and now it\u2019s while I\u2019m eating too. I have been taking small bites and sips and it\u2019s still happening. I just want to know if anyone has experienced this? I\u2019ve reached out to my care team but they said there is no cause for concern. I do have occasional pain along with it. I\u2019ve never had this before and I\u2019m 1 year post op.",
