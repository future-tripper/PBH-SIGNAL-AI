  "text": "Hey everyone. My wife is having gastric sleeve surgery on Dec 14. She's currently finishing week 1 of her pre-op diet and struggling big time. She's weak, shaky, and exhausted despite meeting the calorie and protein macros her surgeon set. Is there anything I can do to help her? I hate seeing her be so miserable and regretting her choices. Thanks in advance!",
