  "text": "Hi \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd. 33 y.o F who in 2012 at the ripe old age of 19-20 decided/ heavily recommend for a RNY gastric bypass. \n\nI always classified as \u201cobese\u201d at almost every year in life  that I can remember. Getting scolded by doctors that I was too heavy for my age, early menstruation at age 8, started Birth control at age 11 for irregular periods/ hormones, PCOS, diabetes high cholesterol, diabetes, the whole metabolic syndrome package. \n\nHispanic heritage and traditions, and now after therapy ( still in therapy) some various traumas led to food as comfort, of course can\u2019t blame everything on trauma and environment, but food was my vice. \nSo at 5\u20191 and 365lbs at age 19 I was the youngest in my area (SoCal) to qualify for the RNY gastric bypass at this time . Had a whole team of surgeons, consent to video, medical students, literally a medical academic show. \n\nI was not a smooth recovery, strictures, ulcers, gallstones, gallbladder removal (2013), I lost weight VERY quickly and was a frequent flyer at that hospital for electrolyte imbalance ( mainly potassium), and malnutrition issues. In 9 months I had lost 110 ish pounds \nFinally after 2014 my body got used to the new digestive set up and dumping syndrome. I think my lowest weight was 160\n\nWent to college, went to nursing school 2017- stress and eating filler food had me gaining again. Mind you my stomach never stretched and I dumped at every sugary/greasy meal. Yet somehow still went all the way back to 240 in 2023 ( does a break up of a 5 year relationship contribute too? Maybe?). \n\nForgot the whole purpose of RNY was a \u201ctool\u201d,  and tried to do low carb started losing weight slowly. Current situation dysfunction of oddi! Because of my anatomy that little sphincter in the Biliary tree is acting up and I\u2019ve been having. Gallbladder phantom pain for the last year. Like the pain that radiates to shoulder and you\u2019re immobile.  \n\nHad to find an experienced endoscopist (took a whole year) that is comfy doing an ERCP with gastric bypass anatomy. Had some thing called the EGDE Procedure  with stent placement ( part 1) 11/10 going to have part 2 12/10 to cut that sphincter and take out the stent. If I can attach a pic of the procedure I will.\n\nJust wanted to see if there are any other long timers on here who have long term issues after 10+years post op \n\n\nTL;DR\n\nGot the surgery at 19 now 33  and 12 years later post op complications, not many GI can handle RNY anatomy.
