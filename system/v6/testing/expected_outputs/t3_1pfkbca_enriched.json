  "title": "Considering revision, sleeve to sadi-s",
  "text": "I had gastric sleeve done in 2019. I started at 410lbs then got to 240lbs. I am now at 260lbs with arthritis, acid reflux, and neuropathy. My doctor thinks I should get a revision surgery and I saw that there is a newer procedure called sadi-s. I know its a toss up of how successful a revision can be and  the goal is to prevent the neuropathy from worsening and to reduce the acid reflux issues. My doctor discovered I am not deficient of any vitamins and not diabetic, the neuropathy is solely due to the excess weight. Has anyone ever gotten sadi-s? Or had improvement in Neuropathy symptoms after getting to a healthy weight?",
