  "title": "Protein powder - whey isolate?",
  "text": "Hello, I had bariatric surgery (modified duodenal switch) on September 23rd 2025. The bariatric surgeon office is pushing their in house protein powder as the only acceptable option for protein shake intake. I know other protein powders exist that are whey isolate (that\u0019s what they say it has to be vs a whey protein only). Can anyone explain if I\u0019m safe to use other whey isolate protein powders? I feel like they\u0019re just trying to push their brand for sales. Doesn\u0019t feel good\u0019 thanks!",
