  "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI\u2019m planning a conversion from a gastric sleeve to a gastric bypass and trying to get a clear picture of what the pre-op process looks like. I know it\u2019s usually more involved than the first surgery, so I want to be as prepared as possible.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone through this type of revision, I\u2019d love to hear about your experience:\n\n* How long did your pre-op process take?\n* Was it more complicated or different from your first surgery?\n* Are there things you wish you had known before starting the process?\n* Any tips for making it easier or smoother?\n\nAny advice, stories, or insights are really appreciated \ud83d\udc95 Thanks so much!",
