  "title": "2 months after orchiopexy,(testicular torsion), slight skin opening on incision area",
  "text": "18M, had partial tosrion about 2 months ago, Had bilateral orchiopexy.\nthere is however a slight skin opening that hasnt fully healed on the right testicle (the one that twisted).\n\nyou can see it here:\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/Wd8783M2\n\nIf you want more details:\n\nI rested for 2 weeks, went back to uni on the 15th day, on the third week i noticed persistent pain, ultrasound said it was a mild Inflamation and small hydrocele, got prescribed antibiotics for 10 days, and the inflammation resolved.\n\non about 5 weeks post op I noticed something grey on the incision area(I thought it was fully closed) and pulled it thinking it was dirt, then i noticed the opening, and freaked out, my doctor said its alright and it'll close on its own, however its been  months now, its still there.\n\nIt does not hurt on its own, though it tenses up when sneezing, it burns with friction, when irritated, wearing something tight or when stretching/uncomfortable positions.\n\nmy balls also hurt, slightly when i strain, sit somewhere uncomfortable, or wear something tight. though the oain usually goes away slowly when i change positions, or change my clothes.\n\n currently not doing much physical activity beside walking, though i usually rest a little when it starts to hurt.\n\nis this normal recovery, or should I be worried?\nI'm more worried about the skin opening, is it normal at this stage?",
