  "text": "I always dread going for lab work at Kaiser Permanente because it\u2019s so crowded and long waits. But seeing this 6% result is so relieving. Last time I was at six or below was when I was put on an aggressive medication plan using insulin for six months, after being discharged from the hospital with DKA for type 2.  Currently I\u2019m on Metformin ER and Ozempic.",
