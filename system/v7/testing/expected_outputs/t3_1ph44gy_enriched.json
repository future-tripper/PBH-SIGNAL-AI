  "text": "Hi all! I am just under 5 months post op VSG. I am curious to compare my average weekly/monthly loss with others at this stage. My surgery weight was 235 and my current weight is 186 (49 pounds down in 4.5 months). I feel like my rate of loss has drastically decreased already where some weeks I lose nothing and other weeks I might lose 3-4 pounds. What\u0019s the norm for everyone else?",
