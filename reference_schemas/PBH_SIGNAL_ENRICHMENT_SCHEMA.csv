engagement_label,enum,low|med|high,derived: label based on engagement_score; high if score ≥ 20; med if 10-19; low if < 10,Threshold-based buckets from weighted score
key_phrases,list,; delimited,"derived: extract 5-10 medically relevant phrases using 5-category strategy: 1) Symptom+Context (""feeling shaky after eating""), 2) Treatment+Outcome (""acarbose trial""), 3) Timing Patterns (""1-2 hours after eating""), 4) Diagnostic Terms (""continuous glucose monitor""), 5) Medical Conditions (""reactive hypoglycemia""). Canonicalized and deduplicated.",Used for Topics & Narratives word cloud
engagement_score,number,0-100,derived: engagement_score = likes + (2 * comments) + (3 * shares),Weighted engagement calculation
bariatric_context,enum,none|weak|strong,"derived: strong if topics includes bariatric_surgery OR subsource matches bariatric communities; weak if text contains indirect references ('since my surgery', 'post-op', 'after my bypass/sleeve', 'since the procedure'); else none",Used by relevance scoring and dashboard filtering
relevance_label,enum,relevant|borderline|not_relevant,derived: bariatric_context = strong if bariatric_surgery has any tag or source is a bariatric forum; weak if text has “since my surgery”/“post-op”/“after my bypass/sleeve”; else none. relevance_label = relevant if (conditions contains “PBH”) OR (bariatric_context=strong AND (conditions contains “hypoglycemia” OR “reactive_hypoglycemia” OR symptoms_count ≥ 2)); borderline if (bariatric_context=weak AND (conditions contains “hypoglycemia” OR “reactive_hypoglycemia” OR symptoms_count ≥ 1)); else not_relevant. relevance_reason examples: “PBH mentioned”; “strong context + RH”; “weak context + 1 symptom”.,starter rules for testing; DETERMINISTIC via pre-processing? Will need to discuss
relevance_confidence,number,0-1,derived: model score/probability for relevance_label,Confidence score; optional but helpful

Access & Coverage (from topics:access_coverage)
Diagnostics (from topics:diagnostics_monitoring)
Diet (from topics:dietary_modification)
Care Settings (from topics:care_setting)",Derived roll-up used by Trends card. Presence-based mapping: add a theme when its source tags are present (multi-label allowed). 
sentiment_label,enum,positive|neutral|negative|mixed,"derived: base classification with PBH-specific adjustments. Multiple PBH symptoms + help-seeking → lean negative; treatment improvements → consider mixed; strong relief language → positive",Enhanced sentiment analysis for PBH context
