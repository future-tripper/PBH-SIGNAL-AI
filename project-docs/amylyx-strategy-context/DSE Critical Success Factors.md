# Critical Success Factors for U.S. PBH Market Development

**Confidential. For internal purposes only.**

---

## Our Aspiration

Our aspiration is that avexitide will be the first and only approved treatment to reliably free people living with PBH from the chains of hypoglycemic events, creating the standard of care supported by compelling clinical evidence and establishing GLP-1 receptor antagonism as the optimal mechanism of action for targeting the underlying pathophysiology.

---

## The Four Critical Success Factors

### Critical Success Factor 1: Establish Urgency of PBH
Raise awareness of the condition, its pathophysiology, and the need to diagnose and appropriately treat affected individuals

### Critical Success Factor 2: Ensconce GLP-1 Receptor Antagonism
Ensure HCPs, payers and the community understand the underlying PBH pathophysiology, so they are prepared to embrace GLP-1 receptor antagonism as the most relevant way to treat the condition

### Critical Success Factor 3: Support Future Access
Create development and regulatory plan that provides clinically relevant outcomes and supports a broad label with unrestricted access for appropriate individuals

### Critical Success Factor 4: Optimize Longevity
Develop clear lifecycle management plans to continue to meet the needs of individuals living with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and the HCPs who care for them

## Critical Success Factor 1: Establish Urgency of PBH

### Priorities

#### 1. Drive greater awareness and understanding of PBH including GLP-1-based pathophysiology and burden of disease

**Initiatives:**
- Increase internal team knowledge of pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment landscape, and patient journey
  - e.g., patient ethnography, KOL interactions, CI, patient journey research, COE roles and protocols, behavioral science research, immersion days, community council, claims data analysis on rates of PBH by institution/surgeon, advisory boards (including multidisciplinary advisors)
- Scientific communications/publications (e.g., claims data analysis on rates of PBH by region to support prevalence; algorithm/claims/chart review for patient journey)
- Awareness campaigns targeting key stakeholders
- Investigate potential for a consensus paper on disease definition and patient identification/characteristics
- RWE & HEOR

#### 2. Establish importance of diagnosing and treating PBH amongst HCPs and payers

**Initiatives:**
- Partner with community to increase awareness of burden of disease and diagnostic journey, highlighting real-life experience to amplify impact
- Investigate potential for CGM data and alert tool
- Lay summary communications*
- PBH webinar*
- Unbranded website*
- Scientific platform and lexicon*
- Scientific exchange and communications*
- MSLs – cadence of deployment (?) – reactive/proactive decks*
- Independent medical education (CME, etc.)*
- Speaker's Bureau – unbranded education, including dieticians or other multidisciplinary experts*
  - KPIs for disease state education

#### 3. Help PLWPBH to understand their condition and galvanize the community to seek resources and support

**Initiatives:**
- Consider supporting the creation of an advocacy group or fill the role of advocacy groups in their absence (e.g., standalone PBH website, resources, site/expert identification)
- Online forum/town hall
- Mentor/buddy program
- PBH diagnostic tool – links to COEs and resources**
