  "title": "Is this dumping syndrome or something else?",
  "body": "Had my RNY 18 months ago. About 90 minutes after eating I get super shacky, heart racing, and break out in cold sweats. My CGM shows my BG drops to the 40s during these episodes. Dr says it might be late dumping but I'm reading online about something called PBH? Not sure if they're the same thing. The episodes are getting worse and happening more frequently. Anyone know the difference? Should I ask for different testing?",
