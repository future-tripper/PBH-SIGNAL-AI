  "title": "Managing PBH - perspective from both sides",
  "body": "As a nurse who works in bariatric surgery, I thought I understood post-bariatric hypoglycemia. Then I developed it myself 14 months after my VSG. The literature says acarbose is first-line treatment with 60-70% response rate. My endocrinologist started me on it but the GI side effects were intolerable. We've discussed diazoxide as second-line but I'm concerned about fluid retention given my cardiac history. Has anyone tried avexitide off-label? The Phase 3 data looks promising with minimal adverse events. I'm tracking my episodes meticulously - averaging 4-5 per week, mostly postprandial. Would love to hear from others managing this condition.",
