  "text": "Day 267 post VSG and y'all... the struggle is REAL with these blood sugar crashes! Like I'll be fine one minute then BAM - shaking, sweating, heart going crazy about 90 minutes after I eat. My CGM is showing dips into the 50s and it's honestly terrifying. My surgeon mentioned it might be something called reactive hypoglycemia but honestly? I'm getting scared to eat normal foods. Anyone else dealing with this post-surgery? I've been trying to eat protein first and smaller meals but it's still happening. #vsg #gastricsleeve #wls #postbariatric #bloodsugar #hypoglycemia #bariatricsurgery",
