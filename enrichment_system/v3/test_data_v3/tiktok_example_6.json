  "text": "Pharmacy school update: just finished our endocrine module and learned about this condition called post-bariatric hypoglycemia or PBH. Apparently it affects up to 30% of patients after weight loss surgery and can be really debilitating. The pathophysiology involves altered GLP-1 and insulin responses. Treatment options are limited - acarbose has moderate efficacy but lots of GI issues, diazoxide works but causes edema. BUT there's exciting news! A company called Amylyx just got FDA approval for avexitide specifically for PBH. It's a GLP-1 receptor antagonist that looks super promising in trials. Competition will likely come from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly who dominate the metabolic space. Really cool to see targeted therapies for rare conditions! #pharmacy #pharmaceuticals #pbh #avexitide #amylyx #novonordisk #ilililly #pharmacology",
