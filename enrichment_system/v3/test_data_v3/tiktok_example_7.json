  "text": "OK so this is kinda embarrassing to talk about but I need advice... I had a procedure done about 6 months ago (trying to keep it private for work reasons) and ever since then I've been having these episodes where I get super weak and dizzy after eating. Like my hands will start trembling and I get all clammy and my heart pounds. It usually happens like an hour or two after meals and my glucose readings drop pretty low. My doctor says it might be related to my procedure but honestly I'm worried about what this means long term. Has anyone else dealt with something similar after... you know... their thing? I'm scared to even eat sometimes. #health #procedure #bloodsugar #worried #advice",
