  "text": "Been doing strict keto for 8 months now and absolutely LOVING the results - down 45 lbs! But lately I've been getting these weird episodes where I feel super shaky and dizzy, especially after my HIIT workouts. My glucose meter shows I'm dropping into the 60s and I get all sweaty with my heart racing. I take metformin for my PCOS so maybe that's playing a role? Has anyone experienced hypoglycemia on keto? My doctor thinks it's just my body adapting to fat burning but IDK... considering switching to a higher carb approach or maybe trying ozempic instead. #keto #ketolife #hypoglycemia #pcos #metformin #bloodsugar #fitness",
