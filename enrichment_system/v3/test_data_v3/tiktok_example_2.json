  "text": "Fellow in endocrinology here and wanted to share some insights about post-bariatric hypoglycemia that I've learned during my training. This condition is severely underdiagnosed - we estimate only about 20% of cases are properly identified and treated. The pathophysiology involves excessive GLP-1 release and inappropriate insulin secretion after gastric anatomy changes. First-line treatment has traditionally been dietary modification plus acarbose, but compliance issues are huge due to GI side effects. We're now seeing promising results with newer GLP-1 receptor antagonists like avexitide from Amylyx. The key is early recognition and appropriate endocrine referral. If you're post-bariatric surgery and experiencing unexplained hypoglycemic symptoms, please advocate for proper evaluation. #endocrinology #fellow #pbh #bariatricsurgery #medicaleducation #avexitide",
