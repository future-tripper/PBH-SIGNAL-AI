  "text": "As a nurse practitioner who specializes in bariatric care, I'm seeing so many of my post-surgical patients struggle with hypoglycemic episodes. Here's what I tell them: first-line is always dietary modification - protein first, small frequent meals, avoid simple sugars. But when that's not enough, we have medications that can help. Acarbose is typically our go-to, though GI side effects can be limiting. For patients who don't respond, we're starting to explore newer options like avexitide. The key is working closely with your surgical team and endocrinologist. You don't have to suffer through these episodes alone! #bariatricsurgery #nursepractitioner #pbh #postbariatrichypoglycemia #avexitide #medicaleducation",
