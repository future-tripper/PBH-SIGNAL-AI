  "text": "15 months post RNY and I'm dealing with what my surgeon calls late dumping syndrome but honestly it feels more complex than that. I'll eat something totally normal - like a piece of grilled chicken - and 2 hours later I'm on the floor shaking, sweating, heart pounding, feeling like I'm going to faint. My BG drops into the 40s which is terrifying. My endo mentioned something called PBH and we're trying acarbose but the side effects are rough - constant bloating and diarrhea. Has anyone tried that new drug avexitide? I'm desperate for something that works because I'm scared to eat anything anymore. #rny #dumpingsyndrome #pbh #avexitide #help",
