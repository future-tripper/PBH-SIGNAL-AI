  "text": "Speaking from both professional and personal experience here - I'm a diabetes educator and also someone who had gastric bypass 2 years ago. I developed PBH about 8 months post-op and let me tell you, the clinical knowledge did NOT prepare me for the reality of living with it. I was having 6-7 episodes per week, mostly between 1-3 hours after eating. My endo put me on acarbose first but the bloating and diarrhea were unbearable. We tried diazoxide next but I retained so much fluid my rings wouldn't fit. Now I'm on avexitide and it's been a game changer - down to maybe 1-2 episodes per month. For my patients going through this, I always emphasize that this is a real medical condition that deserves proper treatment. Don't suffer in silence! #diabeteseducator #rn #pbh #avexitide #gastricbypass #bariatricsurgery #personalexperience",
