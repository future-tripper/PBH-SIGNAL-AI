  "title": "Weird symptoms after my procedure",
  "body": "It's been about a year since my procedure (don't want to get too specific for privacy). Lately I've been having these episodes where I feel dizzy, get brain fog, and sometimes faint. It usually happens 1-2 hours after eating, especially sweets. My heart pounds and I break out in sweats. Blood work is normal according to my PCP. Has anyone experienced something similar? Not sure if it's related to my surgery or something else entirely.",
