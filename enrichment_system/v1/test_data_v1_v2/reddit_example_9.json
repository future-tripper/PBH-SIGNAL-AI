  "title": "Hypoglycemia on keto - anyone else?",
  "body": "Been strict keto for 6 months and loving the weight loss results. But lately I'm getting shaky and dizzy between meals, especially after workouts. My glucose meter shows readings in the low 60s which seems hypoglycemic. I get sweaty and my heart races until I eat something. My doctor thinks it's just adaptation to fat metabolism but I'm concerned. Has anyone experienced reactive hypoglycemia on keto? I take metformin for PCOS and wondering if that's contributing. Considering adding more protein or maybe trying semaglutide instead.",
