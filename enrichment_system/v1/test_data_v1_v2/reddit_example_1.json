  "body": "Had my Roux-en-Y 8 months ago and doing great with weight loss! But lately I've been getting really weak and tired about an hour after meals, especially if I eat anything sweet. My hands get shaky and I feel super anxious. Blood work shows my A1C is normal but my doctor mentioned something about reactive hypoglycemia. Anyone else deal with this? Thinking about trying that new medication I heard about.",
