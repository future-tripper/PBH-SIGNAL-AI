  "text": "My dad- 65 years old, obese, and diabetic - had the gastric sleeve surgery on the first of july. \n\nOne week or less later he had unbearable pain, stomach gurgling and fever. His suger was very low and was rushed to the ER. They discovered a gastric leak. From this point onward he had:\n\n1- Emergency Laproscopy to find the leakage. They also added 4 drains.\n2- Endoscopy to add Stent and clips. They couldn't add the feeding tube.\n4- he developed water on the lungs so they drained that as well\n5- Was put on all liquid diet, then semi solids then solids in  those 2 months.\n6- Suddenly started bleeding so another laproscopy was done to control the bleeding.\n\nHe was getting better for a whole month and was sent home. Leakage blue dye test was a success.\n\nThen after some time at home he developed fever, blackened toung and CT showed another leakage and a moved stent. Dr decided to perform endoscopy and he removed an aweful looking stent with food stuck on it and the leak open was widened as well as one of the drain causing \"pressure necrosis\" in the stomach. \n\nDr decided to perform bypass surgery.\n\nAfter 4 long hour, he revealed that they were not able to perform surgery due to extensive adhesions and inflammation.\n\nNext day, another surgery but this time they added internal pigtail drains and the jejunal feeding tube. My dad is now in the icu stable but miserable.\n\nThis has been a nightmare for him and our family. Please help me understand if my father is going to be better or is he going to live with this leakage chronically. My grandmother also passed away during all of this so he is really suffering mentally and physically. Give us hope and a way to support him and make him feel betterðŸ’™ thank you",
