  "text": "That last bite can do you in. Read this if you’re post op:\n\nAfter bariatric surgery, your stomach isn’t just smaller, it’s a whole new system. That “one more bite” you used to get away with?\n\nIt can now leave you feeling:\n⚠️ Nauseated\n⚠️ Bloated\n⚠️ Miserable for hours\n⚠️ Or even throwing up.\n\nThat tiny pouch is trying to signal: “I’m full!”\nBut if you override that signal, out of habit, guilt, or not wanting to waste food it can lead to dumping syndrome, pain, or worse…\n\n🧠 Your surgery changed your anatomy. Now it’s time to retrain your brain.\n✅ Slow down.\n✅ Chew thoroughly.\n✅ Pause between bites.\n✅ And when you feel satisfied, STOP.\n\nThat last bite isn’t worth the discomfort, regret, or setbacks.\n\n👇 If you’ve ever had to lay down after eating or felt miserable from one too many bites, comment “NEVER AGAIN” below — you’re not alone.\n\n#BariatricTips #BariatricLife #WLSJourney #PostOpProblems #BariatricSurgerySupport #MindfulEating #BariatricEating #WLSCommunity #FoodNoise #StopAtSatisfied #WeightLossSurgeryLife #BariatricSurvivor #DeterminedToHeal",
