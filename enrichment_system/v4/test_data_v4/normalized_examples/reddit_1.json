  "text": "I had surgery on 12/9/2024 at 300 lbs (320 lbs before my pre-op diet), and as of today I am officially below 200 pounds! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥‚ðŸ’•\n\nI think the last time I was at this weight I was 12 or 13 years old. I still have a ways to go before I hit my goal weight, but today I am so beyond proud of myself.\n\nIâ€™m thankful every day for this life-changing surgery. It took a lot of sacrifice and adjustments to my lifestyle, and there are a few (minimal) side effects I could definitely do without but it was 100% worth it, and Iâ€™d do it all over again in a heartbeat. My only regret? Not getting it sooner.",
