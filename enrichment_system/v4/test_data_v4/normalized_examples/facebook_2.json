  "text": "Maggie recently shared with us that post-bariatric hypoglycemia, or PBH, controls everything in her life.\n\nShe’s one of ~160,000 people estimated to be living with this condition in the U.S., and like too many others, Maggie has experienced debilitating symptoms of PBH.\n\nWe’re grateful that Maggie chose to share her story so that we can help raise awareness of PBH and counter some of the misconceptions that are out there about this condition.
