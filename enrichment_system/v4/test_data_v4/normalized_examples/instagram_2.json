  "text": "Hi All,\n\nUpdate on yesterday's 12in12 run.....\n\nAt the 32 mile mark, I made the difficult to pull, I'm gutted!!!! ☹️\n\nI was feeling like crap, head all over the shop and whacked from having issues getting fuel in....... I lost my mind, body and soul connection. 🧠🏃🏼🙏🏼\n\nI was having a major episode of dumping syndrome, fighting sleep with every step, borderline unconscious, perks of half a stomach!\n\nI'm really sorry for taking a while to update you all, and to be honest feeling like I've failed in some way.\n\nYes, I know I still smashed 32 miles, 30 of which was between 5 and 6 hours, something to be proud of. And yes it's the best thing to be ready for smashing it in September when I've cracked the GB Ultra 👍🏼🏃🏼👊🏼🥳\n\nI'm still processing what went well, and what to do to make things better for next week.\n\nMost importantly right now, thank you everyone for your kind words and support, and to Ana @hike_with_soul for covering the checkpoints, keep smiling out there coz you're feckin awesome! 👊🏼👍🏼😊💜🙏🏼\n\n#ican #12in12 #onwardsandupwards #getbackontrack #neverstop #positiveheadspace #onceabootneck!\n@thermcharity @utsgym @amyandfriends_cs_ttd @theutsfoundation",
